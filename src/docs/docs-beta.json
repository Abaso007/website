It can be installed in one line into any existing Next.js app, and is designed to catapult your development process. Payload takes the most complex and time-consuming parts of any modern web app and makes them simple.\n\n### Open source - deploy anywhere, including Vercel\n\nIt's fully open source with an MIT license and you can self-host anywhere that you can run a Node app. You can also deploy serverless to hosts like Vercel, right inside your existing Next.js app folder.\n\n### Fully extensible\n\nEven in spite of how much you get out of the box, you still have full control over every aspect of your app - be it database, admin UI, or anything else. Every part of Payload has been designed to be extensible and customizable with modern TypeScript / React. And you'll fully understand the code that you write.\n\nIn Payload, there are no \"click ops\" - as in clicking around in an admin panel to define your schema. In Payload, everything is done the right way—code-first and version controlled like a proper backend. But once developers define how Payload should work, non-technical users can independently make use of its admin panel to manage whatever they need to without having to know code whatsoever.\n\n## Use cases\n\nPayload started as a headless Content Management System (CMS), but since, we've seen our community leverage Payload in ways far outside of simply managing pages and blog posts. It's grown into a full-stack TypeScript app framework. \n\nLarge enterprises use Payload to power significant internal tools, retailers power their entire storefronts without the need for headless Shopify, and massive amounts of digital assets are stored + managed within Payload. Of course, websites large and small still use Payload for content management as well.\n\n### As a CMS\n\nThe biggest barrier in large web projects cited by marketers is engineering. On the flip side, engineers say the opposite. This is a big problem that has yet to be solved even though we have countless CMS options.\n\nPayload has restored a little love back into the dev / marketer equation with features like Live Preview, redirects, form builders, visual editing, static A/B testing, and more. But even with all this focus on marketing efficiency, we aren't compromising on the developer experience. That way engineers and marketers alike can be proud of the products they build.\n\nIf you're building a website and your frontend is on Next.js, then Payload is a no-brainer. \n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Instead of going out and signing up for a SaaS vendor that makes it so you have to manage two completely separate concerns, with little to no native connection back and forth, just install Payload in your existing Next.js repo and instantly get a full CMS.\n</Banner>\n\nGet started with Payload as a CMS using our official Website template:\n\n```\nnpx create-payload-app@latest -t website\n```\n\n### For enterprise tools\n\nWhen a large organization starts up a new software initiative, there's a lot of plumbing to take care of.\n\n- Scaffold the data layer with an ORM or an app framework like Ruby on Rails or Laravel\n- Implement their SSO provider for authentication\n- Design an access control pattern for authorization\n- Open up any REST endpoints required or implement GraphQL queries / mutations\n- Implement a migrations workflow for the database as it changes over time\n- Integrate with other third party solutions by crafting a system of webhooks or similar\n\nAnd then there's the admin panel. Most enterprise tools require an admin UI, and building one from scratch can be the most time-consuming aspect of any new enterprise tool. There are off-the-shelf packages for app frameworks like Rails, but often the customization is so involved that using Material UI or similar from scratch might be better.\n\nThen there are no-code admin builders that could be used. However, wiring up access control and the connection to the data layer, with proper version control, makes this a challenging task as well.\n\nThat's where Payload comes in. Payload instantly provides all of this out of the box, making complex internal tools extremely simple to both spin up and maintain over time. The only custom code that will need to be written is any custom business logic. That means Payload can expedite timelines, keep budgets low, and allow engineers to focus on their specific requirements rather than complex backend / admin UI plumbing.\n\nGenerally, the best place to start for a new enterprise tool is with a blank canvas, where you can define your own functionality:\n\n```\nnpx create-payload-app@latest -t blank\n```\n\n### Headless commerce\n\nCompanies who prioritize UX generally run into frontend constraints with traditional commerce vendors. These companies will then opt for frontend frameworks like Next.js which allow them to fine-tune their user experience as much as possible—promoting conversions, personalizing experiences, and optimizing for SEO. \n\nBut the challenge with using something like Next.js for headless commerce is that in order for non-technical users to manage the storefront, you instantly need to pair a headless commerce product with a headless CMS. Then, your editors need to bounce back and forth between different admin UIs for different functionality. The code required to seamlessly glue them together on the frontend becomes overly complex.\n\nPayload can integrate with any payment processor like Stripe and its content authoring capabilities allow it to manage every aspect of a storefront—all in one place.\n\nIf you can build your storefront with a single backend, and only offload things like payment processing, the code will be simpler and the editing experience will be significantly streamlined. Manage products, catalogs, page content, media, and more—all in one spot.\n\nPayload's official Ecommerce template gives you everything you need for a storefront out of the box, including a Next.js frontend, product variations, and a full Stripe implementation:\n\n```\nnpx create-payload-app@latest -t ecommerce\n```\n\n### Digital asset management\n\nPayload's API-first tagging, sorting, and querying engine lends itself perfectly to all types of content that a CMS might ordinarily store, but these strong fundamentals also make it a formidable Digital Asset Management (DAM) tool as well.\n\nSimilarly to the Ecommerce use case above, if an organization uses a CMS for its content but a separate DAM for its digital assets, administrators of both tools will need to juggle completely different services for tasks that are closely related. Two subscriptions will need to be managed, two sets of infrastructure will need to be provisioned, and two admin UIs need to be used / learned.\n\nPayload flattens CMS and DAM into a single tool that makes no compromises on either side. Powerful features like folder-based organization, file versioning, bulk upload, and media access control allow Payload to simultaneously function as a full Digital Asset Management platform as well as a Content Management System at the same time.\n\n[Click here](https://payloadcms.com/use-cases/digital-asset-management) for more information on how to get started with Payload as a DAM.\n\n### When Payload might be for you\n\n- If data ownership and privacy are important to you, and you don't want to allow another proprietary SaaS vendor to host and own your data\n- If you're building a Next.js site that needs a CMS\n- If you need to re-use your data outside of a SaaS API\n- If what you're building has custom business logic requirements outside of a typical headless CMS\n- You want to deploy serverless on platforms like Vercel\n\n### When Payload might not be for you\n\n- If you can manage your project fully with code, and don't need an admin UI\n- If you are building a website that fits within the limits a tool like Webflow or Framer\n- If you already have a full database and just need to visualize the data somehow \n- If you are confident that you won't need code / data ownership at any point in the future\n\nReady to get started?

        "content": "\nPayload is based around a small and intuitive set of concepts. Before starting to work with Payload, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the following:\n\n## Config\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">The Payload config is where you configure everything that Payload does.</Banner>\n\nBy default, the Payload config lives in the root folder of your code and is named `payload.config.ts`, but you can customize its name and where you store it. You can write full functions and even full React components right into your config.\n\n## Collections\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  A Collection represents a type of content that Payload will store and can contain many documents.\n</Banner>\n\nCollections define the shape of your data as well as all functionalities attached to that data. They will contain one or many \"documents\", all corresponding with the same fields and functionalities that you define.\n\nThey can represent anything you can store in a database - for example - pages, posts, users, people, orders, categories, events, customers, transactions, and anything else your app needs.\n\n## Globals\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  A Global is a \"one-off\" piece of content that is perfect for storing navigational structures,\n  themes, top-level meta data, and more.\n</Banner>\n\nGlobals are in many ways similar to Collections, but there is only ever **one** instance of a Global, whereas Collections can contain many documents.\n\n## Fields\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Fields are the building blocks of Payload. Collections and Globals both use Fields to define the\n  shape of the data that they store.\n</Banner>\n\nPayload comes with [many different field types](../fields/overview) that give you a ton of flexibility while designing your API. Each Field type has its own potential properties that allow you to customize how they work.\n\n## Hooks\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Hooks are where you can \"tie in\" to existing Payload actions to perform your own additional logic\n  or modify how Payload operates altogether.\n</Banner>\n\nHooks are an extremely powerful concept and are central to extending and customizing your app. Payload provides a wide variety of hooks which you can utilize. For example, imagine if you'd like to send an email every time a document is created in your Orders collection. To do so, you can add an `afterChange` hook function to your Orders collection that receives the Order data and allows you to send an email accordingly.\n\nThere are many more potential reasons to use Hooks. For more, visit the [Hooks documentation](../hooks/overview).\n\n## Access Control\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Access Control refers to Payload's system of defining who can do what to your API.\n</Banner>\n\nAccess Control is extremely powerful but easy and intuitive to manage. You can easily define your own full-blown RBAC (role-based access control) or any other access control pattern that your scenario requires. No conventions or structure is forced on you whatsoever.\n\nFor more, visit the [Access Control documentation](../access-control/overview).\n\n## Retrieving Payload data\n\nEverything Payload does (create, read, update, delete, login, logout, etc) is exposed to you via three APIs:\n\n**1 - Payload's Local API**\n\nBy far one of the most powerful aspects of Payload is the fact that it gives you direct-to-database access to your data. It's _extremely_ fast and does not incur any typical REST API / GraphQL / HTTP overhead - you query your database directly in Node.js / TypeScript.\n\nEverything is strongly typed and it's extremely nice to use. It works anywhere on the server, including custom Next.js route handlers, Payload hooks, Payload access control, and React Server Components.\n\nHere's a quick example of a React Server Component fetching page data with Payload's Local API:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport config from '@payload-config'\nimport { getPayloadHMR } from '@payloadcms/next'\n\nconst MyServerComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // If you're working in Next.js, and you want HMR,\n  // you should get Payload via the `getPayloadHMR` function.\n  const payload = await getPayloadHMR({ config })\n\n  // If you are writing a standalone script and do not need HMR,\n  // you can get Payload via import { getPayload } from 'payload' instead.\n\n  // The `findResult` here will be fully typed as `PaginatedDocs<Page>`,\n  // where you will have the `docs` that are returned as well as\n  // information about how many items are returned / are available in total / etc\n  const findResult = await payload.find({ collection: 'pages' })\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {findResult.docs.map((page) => {\n        // Render whatever here!\n        // The `page` is fully typed as your Pages collection!\n      })}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFor more docs about the Payload Local API, [click here](../beta/local-api/overview).\n\n**2 - The REST API**\n\nBy default, the Payload REST API will be mounted automatically for you at the `/api` path of your app.\n\nFor example, if you have a collection with the `slug` as `pages`, you'd fetch pages via `http://localhost:3000/api/pages`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```ts\nconst pages = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/pages', {\n  // Include cookies, like the Payload auth token\n  credentials: 'include',\n}).then((res) => res.json())\n```\n\nFor a full list of REST API endpoints, including examples, [click here](../beta/rest-api/overview).\n\n**3 - GraphQL**\n\nPayload automatically exposes GraphQL queries and mutations for everything it does.\n\nBy default, you'll find the GraphQL route handler in your `/app/(payload)/api/graphql` folder, which makes the GraphQL endpoint available by default at `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql`.\n\nYou'll also find a full GraphQL Playground which can be accessible via `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql-playground`.\n\nYou can use any GraphQL client with Payload's GraphQL endpoint. Here are a few packages:\n\n- [`graphql-request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) - a very lightweight GraphQL client\n- [`@apollo/client`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/) - an industry-standard GraphQL client with lots of nice features\n\nIf you don't use GraphQL, you can delete those files! But if you do, you'll find that GraphQL is a first-class API in Payload. Either way, the overhead of GraphQL is completely constrained to these endpoints, and will not slow down / affect Payload outside of those endpoints themselves.\n\nFor more docs on GraphQL, [click here](../beta/graphql/overview). \n\n## Depth\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  \"Depth\" gives you control over how many levels down related documents should be automatically\n  populated when retrieved.\n</Banner>\n\nYou can specify population `depth` via query parameter in the REST API and by an option in the local API. _Depth has no effect in the GraphQL API, because there, depth is based on the shape of your queries._\nIt is also possible to limit the depth for specific `relation` and `upload` fields using the `maxDepth` property in your configuration.\n**For example, let's look at the following Collections:** `departments`, `users`, `posts`\n\n```\n// type: 'relationship' fields are equal to 1 depth level\n\n{\n\tslug: 'posts',\n\tfields: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'title',\n\t\t\ttype: 'text',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'author',\n\t\t\tlabel: 'Post Author',\n\t\t\ttype: 'relationship',\n\t\t\trelationTo: 'users',\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n\n{\n\tslug: 'users',\n\tfields: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'email',\n\t\t\ttype: 'email',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'department'\n\t\t\ttype: 'relationship',\n\t\t\trelationTo: 'departments'\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n\n{\n\tslug: 'departments',\n\tfields: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'name'\n\t\t\ttype: 'text',\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nIf you were to query the Posts endpoint at, say, `http://localhost:3000/api/posts?depth=1`, you will retrieve Posts with populations one level deep. This depth parameter can be thought of as N, where N is the number of levels you want to populate. To populate one level further, you would simply specify N+1 as the depth. A returned result may look like the following:\n\n```\n// ?depth=1\n\n{\n  id: '5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832',\n  title: 'This post sucks',\n  author: {\n    id: '5f7dd05cd50d4005f8bcab17',\n    email: 'spiderman@superheroes.gov',\n    department: '5e3ca05cd50d4005f8bdab15'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice how the `user.author` is fully populated, but `user.author.department` is left as a document ID? That's because the User collection counted as the first level of `depth` and got populated—but then prevented any further populations from taking place.\n\nTo populate `user.author.department` in it's entirety you could specify `?depth=2` or _higher_.\n\n```\n// ?depth=2\n\n{\n  id: '5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832',\n  title: 'This post sucks',\n  author: {\n    id: '5f7dd05cd50d4005f8bcab17',\n    email: 'spiderman@superheroes.gov',\n    department: {\n      id: '5e3ca05cd50d4005f8bdab15',\n      name: 'Marvel'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Field-level max depth\n\nFields like relationships or uploads can have a `maxDepth` property that limits the depth of the population for that field. Here are some examples:\n\nDepth: 10\nCurrent depth when field is accessed: 1\n`maxDepth`: undefined\n\nIn this case, the field would be populated to 9 levels of population.\n\nDepth: 10\nCurrent depth when field is accessed: 0\n`maxDepth`: 2\n\nIn this case, the field would be populated to 2 levels of population, despite there being a remaining depth of 8.\n\nDepth: 10\nCurrent depth when field is accessed: 2\n`maxDepth`: 1\n\nIn this case, the field would not be populated, as the current depth (2) has exceeded the `maxDepth` for this field (1).\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When access control on collections prevents relationship fields from populating, the API response\n  will contain the relationship id instead of the full document.\n</Banner>\n\n## Package organization\n\nPayload is abstracted into a set of dedicated packages, and it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with what each one is responsible for.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br/>\n  Version numbers of all official Payload packages are kept in sync - and you should always make sure that you use matching versions for all official Payload packages. \n</Banner>\n\n`payload`\n\nThe `payload` package is where core business logic for Payload lives. You can think of Payload as an ORM with superpowers - it contains the logic for all Payload \"operations\" like `find`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`. It executes access control, hooks, validation, and more.\n\nPayload itself is extremely compact, and can be used in any Node environment. As long as you have `payload` installed and you have access to your Payload config, you can query and mutate your database directly without going through an unnecessary HTTP layer.\n\nPayload also contains all TypeScript definitions, which can be imported from `payload` directly.\n\nHere's how to import some common Payload types:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig, Field, GlobalConfig, Config } from 'payload'\n```\n\n`@payloadcms/next`\n\nWhereas Payload itself is responsible for direct database access, and control over Payload business logic, the `@payloadcms/next` package is responsible for the admin panel and the entire HTTP layer (REST, GraphQL) that Payload exposes. \n\n`@payloadcms/graphql`\n\nAll of Payload's GraphQL functionality is abstracted into a separate package. Payload, its Admin UI, and REST API have absolutely no overlap with GraphQL, and you will incur no performance overhead from GraphQL if you are not using it. However, it's installed within in the `@payloadcms/next` package so you don't have to install it manually. You do, however, need to have GraphQL installed separately in your `package.json` if you are using GraphQL.\n\n`@payloadcms/ui`\n\nThis is the UI library that Payload's admin panel uses. All components are exported from this package and can be re-used as you build extensions to the Payload admin UI, or want to use Payload components in your own React apps. Some exports are server components and some are client components.\n\n`@payloadcms/db-postgres`, `@payloadcms/db-mongodb`\n\nYou can choose which database adapter you'd like to use for your project, and no matter which you choose, the entire data layer for Payload is contained within these packages. You can only use one at a time for any given project.\n\n`@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`, `@payloadcms/richtext-slate`\n\nPayload's Rich Text functionality is abstracted into separate packages and if you want to enable Rich Text in your project, you'll need to install one of these packages. We recommend Lexical for all new projects, and this is where Payload will focus its efforts on from this point, but Slate is still supported if you have already built with it.\n\nRich Text is entirely optional and you may not need it for your project.\n",

To do so, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpx create-payload-app@beta\n```\n\nThen just follow the prompts! You'll get set up with a new folder and a functioning Payload app inside.\n\n## Adding to an existing app\n\nAdding Payload to an existing Next.js app is super straightforward. You can either run the `npx create-payload-app@beta` command inside your Next.js project's folder, or manually install Payload by following the steps below.\n\nIf you don't have a Next.js app already, but you still want to start a project from a blank Next.js app, you can create a new Next.js app using `npx create-next-app` - and then just follow the steps below to install Payload.\n\n#### 1 - install the relevant packages\n\nFirst, you'll want to add the required Payload packages to your project and can do so by running the command below (swap out `pnpm` for your package manager). Note that if you are using NPM, you might need to install using legacy peer deps (`npm i --legacy-peer-deps`).\n\n```\npnpm i payload@beta @payloadcms/next@beta @payloadcms/richtext-lexical@beta sharp graphql\n```\n\nYou'll also need to install the database adapter that you'd like to use. You have the option of Postgres (`@payloadcms/db-postgres`) or MongoDB (`@payloadcms/db-mongodb`).\n\n#### 2 - copy Payload files into your Next.js app folder\n\nPayload installs directly in your Next.js `/app` folder, and you'll need to place some files into that folder for Payload to run.\n\nThe files that Payload needs to have in your `/app` folder do not regenerate, and will never change. Once you slot them in, you never have to revisit them. They are not meant to be edited and simply import Payload dependencies from `@payloadcms/next` for the REST / GraphQL API and Payload admin UI.\n\nYou can copy the Payload `/app` folder files from the Payload blank template on GitHub:\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/templates/blank-3.0/src/app/(payload)\n```\n\nNotice how the Payload files are all kept within the `(payload)` [Route Group](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups)? That's so that the Payload admin UI can have its own separate [Root Layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) which will allow it to not interfere whatsoever with an existing Next.js app if you have one. \n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  You may need to copy all of your existing frontend files, including your existing root layout, into its own newly created route group.\n</Banner>\n\nOnce you have the required Payload files in place in your `/app` folder, you should have something like this:\n\n```\n/app\n  -- (payload) // This is the Payload route group\n     -- layout.tsx // Payload's root layout\n     -- admin // The Payload admin UI\n     -- api // Payload's REST / GraphQL handlers\n     -- custom.scss // Define custom SCSS for the Payload admin here\n  -- (my-app) // this is where your existing app goes\n     -- layout.tsx // move your existing root layout here\n     -- page.tsx // your existing home page\n     -- ...etc // whatever else you have\n```\n\nYou can name the `(my-app)` folder anything you want. The name does not matter and will just be used to clarify your directory structure for yourself. Common names might be `(frontend)`, `(app)`, or similar. [Check out the Admin documentation](../beta/admin/overview) for more information.\n\n#### 3 - add the Payload plugin to your Next.js config\n\nPayload has a plugin that it uses to ensure Next.js compatibility with some of the packages Payload relies on, like `mongodb` or `drizzle-kit`.\n\nYou need to import the `withPayload` plugin in your `next.config.js` file and wrap your config with it.\n\nHere's an example of what your Next.js config should look like after you've imported the Payload plugin:\n\n```js\nimport { withPayload } from '@payloadcms/next/withPayload'\n\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Your Next.js config here\n  experimental: {\n    reactCompiler: false\n  }\n}\n\n// Make sure you wrap your `nextConfig`\n// with the `withPayload` plugin\nexport default withPayload(nextConfig)\n```\n\n**Important:** Payload is a fully ESM project, and that means the `withPayload` function is an EcmaScript module.\n\nTo import it, you need to make sure your `next.config` file is set up to use ESM.\n\nYou can do this in one of two ways:\n\n1. Set your own project to use ESM, by adding `\"type\": \"module\"` to your `package.json` file\n2. Give your Next.js config the `.mjs` file extension\n\nIn either case, all `require`s and `export`s in your `next.config` file will need to be converted to `import` / `export` if they are not set up that way already.\n\n#### 4 - create a Payload config and add it to your TypeScript config\n\nFinally, you need to create a barebones Payload config.\n\nGenerally the Payload config is located at the root of your repository, or next to your `/app` folder, and is named `payload.config.ts`. Here's what Payload needs at a bare minimum:\n\n```ts\nimport sharp from 'sharp'\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\nimport { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  // If you'd like to use Rich Text, pass your editor here\n  editor: lexicalEditor(),\n\n  // Define and configure your collections in this array\n  collections: [],\n\n  // Your Payload secret - should be a complex and secure string, unguessable  \n  secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET || '',\n\n  // Whichever database adapter you're using should go here\n  // Mongoose is shown as an example, but you can also use Postgres \n  db: mongooseAdapter({\n    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI || '',\n  }),\n\n  // If you want to resize images, crop, set focal point, etc.\n  // make sure to install it and pass it to the config.\n  // This is optional - if you don't need to do these things, \n  // you don't need it!\n  sharp,\n})\n```\n\nAlthough this is just the bare minimum config, there are _many_ more options that you can control here. To reference the full config and all of its options, [click here](../configuration/overview).\n\nOnce you have your config created, update your `tsconfig` to include a `path` that points to your config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@payload-config\": [\n        \"./payload.config.ts\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n#### 5 - fire it up!\n\nAfter you've gotten this far, it's time to boot up Payload. Start your project in your application's folder to get going. By default, the Next.js dev script is `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev` if using NPM).\n\nAfter it starts, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/admin` to create your first Payload user!\n",

If you are using Payload outside of Next.js, we suggest using the `dotenv` package to handle environment variables from `.env` files. All that's necessary to do is to require the package as high up in your application as possible (for example, at the top of your `payload.config.ts` file), and ensure that it can find an `.env` file that you create.\n\n**If necessary, you can add this code to the top of your Payload config:**\n\n```ts\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv'\ndotenv.config()\n\n// ...\n// the rest of your `payload.config.ts` file goes here\n```\n\n**Here is an example project structure w/ `dotenv` and an `.env` file:**\n\n```\nproject-name\n---- .env\n---- package.json\n---- payload.config.ts\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you use an environment variable to configure any properties that are required for the Admin\n  panel to function (ex. serverURL or any routes), you need to make sure that your Admin panel code\n  can access it. [Click here](../admin/environment-vars) for more info.\n</Banner>\n\n## Customizing & Automating Config Location Detection\n\nFor Payload command-line scripts, we need to be able to locate your Payload config. We'll check a variety of locations for the presence of `payload.config.ts` by default, including the root current working directory, your `tsconfig`'s `rootDir`, and your `tsconfig`'s `outDir`.\n\nIn development mode, if the configuration file is not found at the root, Payload will attempt to read your `tsconfig.json`, and search in the directory specified in `compilerOptions.rootDir` (typically \"src\").\n\nIn production mode, Payload will first attempt to find the config file in the output directory specified in `compilerOptions.outDir` of your `tsconfig.json`, then fallback to the source directory (`compilerOptions.rootDir`), and finally will check the 'dist' directory.\n\nPlease ensure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured if you want Payload to accurately auto-detect your configuration file location. If `tsconfig.json` does not exist or doesn't specify `rootDir` or `outDir`, Payload will default to the current working directory.\n\n### Overriding the Config Location\n\nIn addition to the above automated detection, you can specify your own location for the Payload config file. This is done by using the environment variable `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH`. The path you provide via this environment variable can either be absolute or relative to your current working directory. This can be useful in situations where your Payload config is not in a standard location, or you wish to switch between multiple configurations.\n\n**Example in package.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"payload\": \"PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/custom-config.ts payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH` is set, Payload will use this path to load the configuration, bypassing all automated detection.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nPayload exposes a variety of TypeScript settings that you can leverage on your Config's `typescript` property.\n\n**`autoGenerate`**\n\nBy default, in Next.js development mode, Payload will auto-generate TypeScript interfaces for all collections and globals that your config defines. \n\nYou can opt out by setting `typescript.autoGenerate: false`.\n\n**`declare`**\n\nBy default, Payload adds a `declare` block to your generated types, which makes sure that Payload uses your generated types for all Local API methods. This promotes strong typing across all of Payload's APIs. However, if you are using your Payload config in a monorepo sub-package, and you are using it in multiple applications, you might want to disable this automatic declaration and then manually add the `declare` block to a file that you control.\n\nIn these cases, you can set `typescript.declare: false` to opt out.\n\n**`outputFile`**\n\nYou can control the output path and filename of Payload's auto-generated types by defining the `typescript.outputFile` property to a full, absolute path.\n\n### Importing Payload config types\n\nYou can import config types as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { Config } from 'payload'\n\n// This is the type used for an incoming Payload config.\n// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.\n```\n\n```ts\nimport { SanitizedConfig } from 'payload'\n\n// This is the type used after an incoming Payload config is fully sanitized.\n// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.\n```\n\n### Server config vs. client config\n\nPayload's full config is only available on the server, but Payload dynamically reduces your config down to only what is safe to send to the client-side admin panel. All server-only properties are removed as well as all functions (hooks, validations, conditional logic, access control, etc). \n\nAnywhere within the client-side admin UI, you can access your client-safe config which is typed as `ClientConfig`. The client config is JSON-serializable.\n\nHere's an example showing how to access your config on the client-side:\n\n```ts\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { useConfig } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // Get access to your config\n  const config = useConfig()\n\n  return (\n    // ..\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Telemetry\n\nPayload collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage. This data is super important to us and helps us accurately understand how we're growing and what we can do to build the software into everything that it can possibly be. The telemetry that we collect also help us demonstrate our growth in an accurate manner, which helps us as we seek investment to build and scale our team. If we can accurately demonstrate our growth, we can more effectively continue to support Payload as free and open-source software. To opt out of telemetry, you can pass `telemetry: false` within your Payload config.\n\nFor more information about what we track, take a look at our [privacy policy](/privacy).\n",

The document being edited\n1. An `options` object, containing `locale`, `req` and `token` properties. The `token` is the currently logged-in user's JWT.\n\n**Example collection with preview function:**\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Posts: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'posts',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'slug',\n      type: 'text',\n      required: true,\n    },\n  ],\n  admin: {\n    preview: (doc, { locale }) => {\n      if (doc?.slug) {\n        return `https://bigbird.com/preview/posts/${doc.slug}?locale=${locale}`\n      }\n\n      return null\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Pagination\n\nHere are a few options that you can specify options for pagination on a collection-by-collection basis:\n\n| Option         | Description                                                                                         |\n| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `defaultLimit` | Integer that specifies the default per-page limit that should be used. Defaults to 10.              |\n| `limits`       | Provide an array of integers to use as per-page options for admins to choose from in the List view. |\n\n## Access control\n\nYou can specify extremely granular access control (what users can do with documents in a collection) on a collection by\ncollection basis. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) docs.\n\n## Hooks\n\nHooks are a powerful way to extend collection functionality and execute your own logic, and can be defined on a\ncollection by collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.\n\n## Field types\n\nCollections support all field types that Payload has to offer—including simple fields like text and checkboxes all the\nway to more complicated layout-building field groups like Blocks. [Click here](../fields/overview) to learn more\nabout field types.\n\n## List Searchable Fields\n\nIn the List view, there is a \"search\" box that allows you to quickly find a document with a search. By default, it\nsearches on the ID field. If you have `admin.useAsTitle` defined, the list search will use that field. However, you can\ndefine more than one field to search to make it easier on your admin editors to find the data they need.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a Posts collection with `title`, `metaDescription`, and `tags` fields - and you want all\nthree of those fields to be searchable in the List view. You can simply\nadd `admin.listSearchableFields: ['title', 'metaDescription', 'tags']` - and the admin UI will automatically search on\nthose three fields plus the ID field.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you are adding <strong>listSearchableFields</strong>, make sure you index each of these fields\n  so your admin queries can remain performant.\n</Banner>\n\n## TypeScript\n\nYou can import collection types as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\n// This is the type used for incoming collection configs.\n// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.\n```\n\n```ts\nimport { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\n// This is the type used after an incoming collection config is fully sanitized.\n// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.\n```\n",

The big difference is that Collections will potentially contain _many_ documents, while a Global is a \"one-off\". Globals are perfect for things like header nav, site-wide banner alerts, app-wide localized strings, and other \"global\" data that your site or app might rely on.\n\nAs with Collection configs, it's often best practice to write your Globals in separate files and then import them into the main Payload config.\n\n## Options\n\n| Option             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`slug`** \\*      | Unique, URL-friendly string that will act as an identifier for this Global.                                                                                                                                          |\n| **`fields`** \\*    | Array of field types that will determine the structure and functionality of the data stored within this Global.

Auto-generated from slug if not defined.\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n### Simple Global example\n\n```ts\nimport { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst Nav: GlobalConfig = {\n  slug: 'nav',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'items',\n      type: 'array',\n      required: true,\n      maxRows: 8,\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'page',\n          type: 'relationship',\n          relationTo: 'pages', // \"pages\" is the slug of an existing collection\n          required: true,\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\nexport default Nav\n```\n\n### Global config example\n\nYou can find a few [example Global configs](https://github.com/payloadcms/public-demo/tree/master/src/payload/globals) in the Public Demo source code on GitHub.\n\n## Admin options\n\nYou can customize the way that the Admin panel behaves on a Global-by-Global basis by defining the `admin` property on a Global's config.\n\n| Option        | Description                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `group`       | Text used as a label for grouping collection and global links together in the navigation.                                         |\n| `hidden`      | Set to true or a function, called with the current user, returning true to exclude this global from navigation and admin routing. |\n| `components`  | Swap in your own React components to be used within this Global. [More](../admin/components#globals)                           |\n| `preview`     | Function to generate a preview URL within the Admin panel for this global that can point to your app. [More](#preview).           |\n| `livePreview` | Enable real-time editing for instant visual feedback of your front-end application. [More](../live-preview/overview).          |\n| `hideAPIURL`  | Hides the \"API URL\" meta field while editing documents within this collection.                                                    |\n| `meta`        | Metadata overrides to apply to the [Admin panel](../admin/overview). Included properties are `description` and `openGraph`.       |\n\n## Preview\n\nGlobal `admin` options can accept a `preview` function that will be used to generate a link pointing to the frontend of your app to preview data.\n\nIf the function is specified, a Preview button will automatically appear in the corresponding global's Edit view. Clicking the Preview button will link to the URL that is generated by the function.\n\n**The preview function accepts two arguments:**\n\n1. The document being edited\n1. An `options` object, containing `locale` and `token` properties. The `token` is the currently logged-in user's JWT.\n\n**Example global with preview function:**\n\n```ts\nimport { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyGlobal: GlobalConfig = {\n  slug: 'my-global',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'slug',\n      type: 'text',\n      required: true,\n    },\n  ],\n  admin: {\n    preview: (doc, { locale }) => {\n      if (doc?.slug) {\n        return `https://bigbird.com/preview/${doc.slug}?locale=${locale}`\n      }\n\n      return null\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Access control\n\nAs with Collections, you can specify extremely granular access control (what users can do with this Global) on a Global-by-Global basis. However, Globals only have `update` and `read` access control due to their nature of only having one document. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) docs.\n\n## Hooks\n\nGlobals also fully support a smaller subset of Hooks. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.\n\n## Field types\n\nGlobals support all field types that Payload has to offer—including simple fields like text and checkboxes all the way to more complicated layout-building field groups like Blocks. [Click here](../fields/overview) to learn more about field types.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nYou can import global types as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'\n\n// This is the type used for incoming global configs.\n// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.\n```\n\n```ts\nimport { SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\n// This is the type used after an incoming global config is fully sanitized.\n// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.\n```\n",

        "content": "\nNot only does Payload support managing localized content, it also has internationalization support so that admin users can work in their preferred language. \n\nBy default, Payload comes with English installed as the language it uses. But, you can import and pass other languages to the Payload config as well. It's best to only support the languages that you need, because that way, the bundled JavaScript is kept to a minimum for your project.\n\nHere's an example for how to pass additional languages to Payload for use in translating:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\nimport { en } from 'payload/i18n/en'\nimport { de } from 'payload/i18n/de'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  /**\n   * Payload accepts specific translations to use.\n   * This is completely optional and will default to English if not provided\n   */\n  i18n: {\n    // Payload will support either English or German,\n    // able to be specified in preferences on a user-by-user basis\n    supportedLanguages: { en, de },\n  },\n\n  // .. the rest of your config\n})\n```\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nIn your Payload config, you can add translations and customize the settings in `i18n`. Payload will use your custom options and merge it with the default, allowing you to override the settings Payload provides.\n\n**Example Payload config extending i18n:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  //...\n  i18n: {\n    fallbackLng: 'en', // default\n    debug: false, // default\n    resources: {\n      en: {\n        custom: {\n          // namespace can be anything you want\n          key1: 'Translation with {{variable}}', // translation\n        },\n        // override existing translation keys\n        general: {\n          dashboard: 'Home',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  //...\n})\n```\n\nWhile Payload's built-in features come translated, you may want to also translate parts of your project's configuration too. This is possible in places like Collections and Globals labels and groups, field labels, descriptions and input placeholder text. The admin UI will display all the correct translations you provide based on the user's language.\n\nHere is an example of a simple collection supporting both English and Spanish editors:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Articles: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'articles',\n  labels: {\n    singular: {\n      en: 'Article',\n      es: 'Artículo',\n    },\n    plural: {\n      en: 'Articles',\n      es: 'Artículos',\n    },\n  },\n  admin: {\n    group: { en: 'Content', es: 'Contenido' },\n  },\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      type: 'text',\n      label: {\n        en: 'Title',\n        es: 'Título',\n      },\n      admin: {\n        placeholder: { en: 'Enter title', es: 'Introduce el título' },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'type',\n      type: 'radio',\n      options: [\n        {\n          value: 'news',\n          label: { en: 'News', es: 'Noticias' },\n        }, // etc...\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Admin UI\n\nThe [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) reads the language settings of a user's browser and display all text in that language, or will fall back to English if the user's language is not yet supported.\nAfter a user logs in, they can change their language selection in the `/account` view.\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If there is a language that Payload does not yet support, we accept code\n  [contributions](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). You can also make and import your own translation files.\n</Banner>\n\n## Node\n\nPayload's backend sets the language on incoming requests before they are handled. This allows backend validation to return error messages in the user's own language or system generated emails to be sent using the correct translation. You can make HTTP requests with the `accept-language` header and Payload will use that language.\n\nAnywhere in your Payload app that you have access to the `req` object, you can access payload's extensive internationalization features assigned to `req.i18n`. To access text translations you can use `req.t('namespace:key')`.\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nIn your Payload config, you can add translations and customize the settings in `i18n`. Payload will use your custom options and merge it with the default, allowing you to override the settings Payload provides.\n\n**Example Payload config extending i18n:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  //...\n  i18n: {\n    fallbackLanguage: 'en', // default\n    translations: {\n      en: {\n        custom: {\n          // namespace can be anything you want\n          key1: 'Translation with {{variable}}', // translation\n        },\n        // override existing translation keys\n        general: {\n          dashboard: 'Home',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  //...\n})\n```\n\n## Types for custom translations\n\nIn order to use custom translations in your project, you need to provide the types for the translations. Here is an example of how you can define the types for the custom translations in a custom react component:\n\n```ts\n'use client'\nimport type { NestedKeysStripped } from '@payloadcms/translations'\nimport type React from 'react'\n\nimport { useTranslation } from '@payloadcms/ui/providers/Translation'\n\nconst customTranslations = {\n  en: {\n    general: {\n      test: 'Custom Translation',\n    },\n  },\n}\n\ntype CustomTranslationObject = typeof customTranslations.en\ntype CustomTranslationKeys = NestedKeysStripped<CustomTranslationObject>\n\nexport const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const { i18n, t } = useTranslation<CustomTranslationObject, CustomTranslationKeys>() // These generics merge your custom translations with the default client translations\n\n  return t('general:test')\n}\n\n```\n\nAdditionally, payload exposes the `t` function in various places, for example in labels. Here is how you would type those:\n\n```ts\nimport type {\n  DefaultTranslationKeys,\n  NestedKeysStripped,\n  TFunction,\n} from '@payloadcms/translations'\nimport type { Field } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst customTranslations = {\n  en: {\n    general: {\n      test: 'Custom Translation',\n    },\n  },\n}\n\ntype CustomTranslationObject = typeof customTranslations.en\ntype CustomTranslationKeys = NestedKeysStripped<CustomTranslationObject>\n\nconst field: Field = {\n  name: 'myField',\n  type: 'text',\n  label: (\n    { t }: { t: TFunction<CustomTranslationKeys | DefaultTranslationKeys> }, // The generic passed to TFunction does not automatically merge the custom translations with the default translations. We need to merge them ourselves here\n  ) => t('fields:addLabel'),\n}\n```\n\n",

        "content": "\nPayload features deep field-based localization support. Maintaining as many locales as you need is easy. All\nlocalization support is opt-in by default. To do so, follow the two steps below.\n\n## Enabling in the Payload config\n\nAdd the `localization` property to your Payload config to enable localization project-wide. You'll need to provide a\nlist of all locales that you'd like to support as well as set a few other options.\n\n**Example Payload config set up for localization:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // collections go here\n  ],\n  localization: {\n    locales: ['en', 'es', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n    fallback: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example Payload config set up for localization with full locales objects:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // collections go here\n  ],\n  localization: {\n    locales: [\n      {\n        label: 'English',\n        code: 'en',\n      },\n      {\n        label: 'Arabic',\n        code: 'ar',\n        // opt-in to setting default text-alignment on Input fields to rtl (right-to-left)\n        // when current locale is rtl\n        rtl: true,\n      },\n    ],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n    fallback: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example Payload config set up for localization with full locales objects (\nincluding [internationalization](../configuration/i18n) support):**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // collections go here\n  ],\n  localization: {\n    locales: [\n      {\n        label: {\n          en: 'English', // English label\n          nb: 'Engelsk', // Norwegian label\n        },\n        code: 'en',\n      },\n      {\n        label: {\n          en: 'Norwegian', // English label\n          nb: 'Norsk', // Norwegian label\n        },\n        code: 'nb',\n      },\n    ],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n    fallback: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Here is a brief explanation of each of the options available within the `localization` property:**\n\n**`locales`**\n\nArray-based list of all the languages that you would like to support. This can be an array containing strings for each\nlanguage code you want your project to store and serve or objects with a `label`, a locale `code`, `rtl` (\nright-to-left), and `fallbackLocale` property. The locale codes do not need to be in any specific format. It's up to you\nto define how to represent your locales. Common patterns are to use two-letter ISO 639 language codes or four-letter\nlanguage and country codes (ISO 3166‑1) such as `en-US`, `en-UK`, `es-MX`, etc.\n\n## Locale Object Properties\n\n| Option               | Description                                                                                                                    |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **`code`** \\*        | Unique code to identify the language throughout the APIs for `locale` and `fallbackLocale`                                     |\n| **`label`**          | A string to use for the selector when choosing a language, or an object keyed on the i18n keys for different languages in use. |\n| **`rtl`**            | A boolean that when true will make the admin UI display in Right-To-Left.                                                      |\n| **`fallbackLocale`** | The code for this language to fallback to when properties of a document are not present.                                       |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n**`defaultLocale`**\n\nRequired string that matches one of the locale codes from the array provided. By default, if no locale is specified,\ndocuments will be returned in this locale.\n\n**`fallback`**\n\nBoolean enabling \"fallback\" locale functionality. If a document is requested in a locale, but a field does not have a\nlocalized value corresponding to the requested locale, then if this property is enabled, the document will automatically\nfall back to the fallback locale value. If this property is not enabled, the value will not be populated.\n\n## Field by field localization\n\nPayload localization works on a **field** level—not a document level. In addition to configuring the base Payload config\nto support localization, you need to specify each field that you would like to localize.\n\n**Here is an example of how to enable localization for a field:**\n\n```js\n{\n  name: 'title',\n  type: 'text',\n  // highlight-start\n  localized: true,\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, the `title` field will now be saved in the database as an object of all locales instead of\na single string.\n\nAll field types with a `name` property support the `localized` property—even the more complex field types like `array`s\nand `block`s.\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Enabling localization for field types that support nested fields will automatically create\n  localized \"sets\" of all fields contained within the field. For example, if you have a page layout\n  using a blocks field type, you have the choice of either localizing the full layout, by enabling\n  localization on the top-level blocks field, or only certain fields within the layout.\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When converting an existing field to or from `localized: true` the data structure in the document\n  will change for this field and so existing data for this field will be lost. Before changing the\n  localization setting on fields with existing data, you may need to consider a field migration\n  strategy.\n</Banner>\n\n## Retrieving localized docs\n\nWhen retrieving documents, you can specify which locale you'd like to receive as well as which fallback locale should be\nused.\n\n#### REST API\n\nREST API locale functionality relies on URL query parameters.\n\n**`?locale=`**\n\nSpecify your desired locale by providing the `locale` query parameter directly in the endpoint URL.\n\n**`?fallback-locale=`**\n\nSpecify fallback locale to be used by providing the `fallback-locale` query parameter. This can be provided as either a\nvalid locale as provided to your base Payload config, or `'null'`, `'false'`, or `'none'` to disable falling back.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nfetch('https://localhost:3000/api/pages?locale=es&fallback-locale=none');\n```\n\n#### GraphQL API\n\nIn the GraphQL API, you can specify `locale` and `fallbackLocale` args to all relevant queries and mutations.\n\nThe `locale` arg will only accept valid locales, but locales will be formatted automatically as valid GraphQL enum\nvalues (dashes or special characters will be converted to underscores, spaces will be removed, etc.). If you are curious\nto see how locales are auto-formatted, you can use the [GraphQL playground](../graphql/overview#graphql-playground).\n\nThe `fallbackLocale` arg will accept valid locales as well as `none` to disable falling back.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  Posts(locale: de, fallbackLocale: none) {\n    docs {\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  In GraphQL, specifying the locale at the top level of a query will automatically apply it\n  throughout all nested relationship fields. You can override this behavior by re-specifying locale\n  arguments in nested related document queries.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Local API\n\nYou can specify `locale` as well as `fallbackLocale` within the Local API as well as properties on the `options`\nargument. The `locale` property will accept any valid locale, and the `fallbackLocale` property will accept any valid\nlocale as well as `'null'`, `'false'`, `false`, and `'none'`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\nconst posts = await payload.find({\n  collection: 'posts',\n  locale: 'es',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"alert\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The REST and Local APIs can return all localization data in one request by passing 'all' or '*' as\n  the <strong>locale</strong> parameter. The response will be structured so that field values come\n  back as the full objects keyed for each locale instead of the single, translated value.\n</Banner>\n",

        "content": "\nPayload interacts with your database via the database adapter that you choose. Right now, Payload officially supports two database adapters:\n\n1. [MongoDB](../database/mongodb) w/ [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)\n1. [Postgres](../database/postgres) w/ [Drizzle](https://drizzle.team/)\n\nWe will be adding support for SQLite and MySQL in the near future using Drizzle ORM.\n\nTo use a specific database adapter, you need to install it and configure it according to its own specifications. Visit the documentation for your applicable database adapter to learn more.\n\n## Selecting a database\n\nThere are several factors to consider when choosing which database technology and hosting option is right for your project and workload. Payload can theoretically support any database, but it's up to you to decide which database to use.\n\n### When to use MongoDB\n\nIf your project has a lot of dynamic fields, and you are comfortable with allowing Payload to enforce data integrity across your documents, MongoDB is a great choice. With it, your Payload documents are stored as _one_ document in your database—no matter if you have localization enabled, how many block or array fields you have, etc. This means that the shape of your data in your database will very closely reflect your field schema, and there is minimal complexity involved in storing or retrieving your data.\n\nYou should prefer MongoDB if:\n\n- You prefer simplicity within your database\n- You don't want to deal with keeping production / staging databases in sync via [DDL changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language)\n- Most (or everything) in your project is localized\n- You leverage a lot of array fields, block fields, or `hasMany` select fields and similar\n\n### When to use a relational DB\n\nMany projects might call for more rigid database architecture where the shape of your data is strongly enforced at the database level. For example, if you know the shape of your data and it's relatively \"flat\", and you don't anticipate it to change often, your workload might suit relational databases like Postgres very well.\n\nYou should prefer a relational DB like Postgres if:\n\n- You are comfortable with migration workflows\n- You require enforced data consistency at the database level\n- You have a lot of relationships between collections and require relationships to be enforced\n\n### Differences in Payload features\n\nIt's important to note that almost everything Payload does is available in all of our officially supported database adapters, including localization, arrays, blocks, etc.\n\nThe only thing that is not supported in Postgres yet is the [Point field](../fields/point), but that should be added soon.\n\nIt's up to you to choose which database you would like to use.\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo configure the database for your Payload application, an adapter can be assigned to `config.db`. This property is required within your Payload config.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```ts\nimport { postgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  // Your config goes here\n  collections: [\n    // Collections go here\n  ],\n  // Here is where you pass your database adapter\n  // and the adapter will require options specific to itself\n  db: postgresAdapter({\n    pool: {\n      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URI,\n    },\n  }),\n})\n```\n",

        "content": "\nPayload exposes a full suite of migration controls available for your use. Migration commands are accessible via\nthe `npm run payload` command in your project directory.\n\nEnsure you have an npm script called \"payload\" in your `package.json` file.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"payload\": \"cross-env PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  Note that you need to run Payload migrations through the package manager that you are using,\n  because Payload should not be globally installed on your system.\n</Banner>\n\n## Migration file contents\n\nPayload stores all created migrations in a folder that you can specify. By default, migrations are stored\nin `./src/migrations`.\n\nA migration file has two exports - an `up` function, which is called when a migration is executed, and a `down` function\nthat will be called if for some reason the migration fails to complete successfully. The `up` function should contain\nall changes that you attempt to make within the migration, and the `down` should ideally revert any changes you make.\n\nFor an added level of safety, migrations should leverage Payload [transactions](../database/transactions). Migration\nfunctions should make use of the `req` by adding it to the arguments of your payload local API calls such\nas `payload.create` and database adapter methods like `payload.db.create`.\n\nHere is an example migration file:\n\n```ts\nimport { MigrateUpArgs, MigrateDownArgs } from '@payloadcms/your-db-adapter'\n\nexport async function up({ payload, req }: MigrateUpArgs): Promise<void> {\n  // Perform changes to your database here.\n  // You have access to `payload` as an argument, and\n  // everything is done in TypeScript.\n}\n\nexport async function down({ payload, req }: MigrateDownArgs): Promise<void> {\n  // Do whatever you need to revert changes if the `up` function fails\n}\n```\n\n## Migrations Directory\n\nEach DB adapter has an optional property `migrationDir` where you can override where you want your migrations to be\nstored/read. If this is not specified, Payload will check the default and possibly make a best effort to find your\nmigrations directory by searching in common locations ie. `./src/migrations`, `./dist/migrations`, `./migrations`, etc.\n\nAll database adapters should implement similar migration patterns, but there will be small differences based on the\nadapter and its specific needs. Below is a list of all migration commands that should be supported by your database\nadapter.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Migrate\n\nThe `migrate` command will run any migrations that have not yet been run.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate\n```\n\n### Create\n\nCreate a new migration file in the migrations directory. You can optionally name the migration that will be created. By\ndefault, migrations will be named using a timestamp.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:create optional-name-here\n```\n\n### Status\n\nThe `migrate:status` command will check the status of migrations and output a table of which migrations have been run,\nand which migrations have not yet run.\n\n`payload migrate:status`\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:status\n```\n\n### Down\n\nRoll back the last batch of migrations.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:down\n```\n\n### Refresh\n\nRoll back all migrations that have been run, and run them again.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:refresh\n```\n\n### Reset\n\nRoll back all migrations.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:reset\n```\n\n### Fresh\n\nDrops all entities from the database and re-runs all migrations from scratch.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:fresh\n```\n\n## When to run migrations\n\nDepending on which database adapter you use, your migration workflow might differ subtly.\n\nIn relational databases, migrations will be **required** for non-development database environments. But with MongoDB, you might only need to run migrations once in a while (or never even need them).\n\n#### MongoDB\n\nIn MongoDB, you'll only ever really need to run migrations for times where you change your database shape, and you have lots of existing data that you'd like to transform from Shape A to Shape B.\n\nIn this case, you can create a migration by running `pnpm payload migrate:create`, and then write the logic that you need to perform to migrate your documents to their new shape. You can then either run your migrations in CI before you build / deploy, or you can run them locally, against your production database, by using your production database connection string on your local computer and running the `pnpm payload migrate` command.\n\n#### Postgres\n\nIn relational databases like Postgres, migrations are a bit more important, because each time you add a new field or a new collection, you'll need to update the shape of your database to match your Payload config (otherwise you'll see errors upon trying to read / write your data).\n\nThat means that Postgres users of Payload should become familiar with the entire migration workflow from top to bottom.\n\nHere is an overview of a common workflow for working locally against a development database, creating migrations, and then running migrations against your production database before deploying.\n\n**1 - work locally using push mode**\n\nPayload uses Drizzle ORM's powerful `push` mode to automatically sync data changes to your database for you while in development mode. By default, this is enabled and is the suggested workflow to using Postgres and Payload while doing local development.\n\nYou can disable this setting and solely use migrations to manage your local development database (pass `push: false` to your Postgres adapter), but if you do disable it, you may see frequent errors while running development mode. This is because Payload will have updated to your new data shape, but your local database will not have updated.\n\nFor this reason, we suggest that you leave `push` as its default setting and treat your local dev database as a sandbox.\n\nFor more information about push mode and prototyping in development, [click here](../beta/database/postgres#prototyping-in-dev-mode).\n\nThe typical workflow in Payload is to build out your Payload configs, install plugins, and make progress in development mode - allowing Drizzle to push your changes to your local database for you. Once you're finished, you can create a migration.\n\nBut importantly, you do not need to run migrations against your development database, because Drizzle will have already pushed your changes to your database for you.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Warning: do not mix \"push\" and migrations with your local development database. If you use \"push\"\n  locally, and then try to migrate, Payload will throw a warning, telling you that these two methods\n  are not meant to be used interchangeably.\n</Banner>\n\n**2 - create a migration**\n\nOnce you're done with working in your Payload config, you can create a migration. It's best practice to try and complete a specific task or fully build out a feature before you create a migration.\n\nBut once you're ready, you can run `pnpm payload migrate:create`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n\n- We will look for any existing migrations, and automatically generate SQL changes necessary to convert your schema from its prior state to the new state of your Payload config\n- We will then create a new migration file in your `/migrations` folder that contains all the SQL necessary to be run\n\nWe won't immediately run this migration for you, however. \n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Tip: migrations created by Payload are relatively programmatic in nature, so there should not be any surprises, but before you check in the created migration it's a good idea to always double-check the contents of the migration files.\n</Banner>\n\n**3 - set up your build process to run migrations**\n\nGenerally, you want to run migrations before you build Payload for production. This typically happens in your CI pipeline and can usually be configured on platforms like Payload Cloud, Vercel, or Netlify by specifying your build script.\n\nA common set of scripts in a `package.json`, set up to run migrations in CI, might look like this:\n\n```js\n  \"scripts\": {\n    // For running in dev mode\n    \"dev\": \"next dev --turbo\",\n\n    // To build your Next + Payload app for production\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n\n    // A \"tie-in\" to Payload's CLI for convenience\n    // this helps you run `pnpm payload migrate:create` and similar\n    \"payload\": \"cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--no-deprecation payload\",\n\n    // This command is what you'd set your `build script` to.\n    // Notice how it runs `payload migrate` and then `pnpm build`?\n    // This will run all migrations for you before building, in your CI,\n    // against your production database\n    \"ci\": \"payload migrate && pnpm build\",\n  },\n```\n\nIn the example above, we've specified a `ci` script which we can use as our \"build script\" in the platform that we are deploying to production with.\n\nThis will require that your build pipeline can connect to your database, and it will simply run the `payload migrate` command prior to starting the build process. By calling `payload migrate`, Payload will automatically execute any migrations in your `/migrations` folder that have not yet been executed against your production database, in the order that they were created.\n\nIf it fails, the deployment will be rejected. But now, with your build script set up to run your migrations, you will be all set! Next time you deploy, your CI will execute the required migrations for you, and your database will be caught up with the shape that your Payload config requires.\n",

        "content": "\nDatabase transactions allow your application to make a series of database changes in an all-or-nothing commit. Consider an HTTP request that creates a new **Order** and has an `afterChange` hook to update the stock count of related **Items**. If an error occurs when updating an **Item** and an HTTP error is returned to the user, you would not want the new **Order** to be persisted or any other items to be changed either. This kind of interaction with the database is handled seamlessly with transactions.\n\nBy default, Payload will use transactions for all operations, as long as it is supported by the configured database. Database changes are contained within all Payload operations and any errors thrown will result in all changes being rolled back without being committed. When transactions are not supported by the database, Payload will continue to operate as expected without them.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  MongoDB requires a connection to a replicaset in order to make use of transactions.\n</Banner>\n\nThe initial request made to Payload will begin a new transaction and attach it to the `req.transactionID`. If you have a `hook` that interacts with the database, you can opt-in to using the same transaction by passing the `req` in the arguments. For example:\n\n```ts\nconst afterChange: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({ req }) => {\n  // because req.transactionID is assigned from Payload and passed through,\n  // my-slug will only persist if the entire request is successful\n  await req.payload.create({\n    req,\n    collection: 'my-slug',\n    data: {\n      some: 'data',\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## Async Hooks with Transactions\n\nSince Payload hooks can be async and be written to not await the result, it is possible to have an incorrect success response returned on a request that is rolled back. If you have a hook where you do not `await` the result, then you should **not** pass the `req.transactionID`.\n\n```ts\nconst afterChange: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({ req }) => {\n  // WARNING: an async call made with the same req, but NOT awaited,\n  // may fail resulting in an OK response being returned with response data that is not committed\n  const dangerouslyIgnoreAsync = req.payload.create({\n    req,\n    collection: 'my-slug',\n    data: {\n      some: 'other data',\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Should this call fail, it will not rollback other changes\n  // because the req (and its transactionID) is not passed through\n  const safelyIgnoredAsync = req.payload.create({\n    collection: 'my-slug',\n    data: {\n      some: 'other data',\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## Direct Transaction Access\n\nWhen writing your own scripts or custom endpoints, you may wish to have direct control over transactions. This is useful for interacting with your database outside of Payload's local API.\n\nThe following functions can be used for managing transactions:\n\n`payload.db.beginTransaction` - Starts a new session and returns a transaction ID for use in other Payload Local API calls.\n`payload.db.commitTransaction` - Takes the identifier for the transaction, finalizes any changes.\n`payload.db.rollbackTransaction` - Takes the identifier for the transaction, discards any changes.\n",

        "content": "\nTo use Payload with Postgres, install the package `@payloadcms/db-postgres`. It leverages Drizzle ORM and `node-postgres` to interact with a Postgres database that you provide.\n\nIt automatically manages changes to your database for you in development mode, and exposes a full suite of migration controls for you to leverage in order to keep other database environments in sync with your schema. DDL transformations are automatically generated.\n\nTo configure Payload to use Postgres, pass the `postgresAdapter` to your Payload config as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { postgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  // Your config goes here\n  collections: [\n    // Collections go here\n  ],\n  // Configure the Postgres adapter here\n  db: postgresAdapter({\n    // Postgres-specific arguments go here.\n    // `pool` is required.\n    pool: {\n      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URI,\n    },\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n## Options\n\n| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `pool` \\*             | [Pool connection options](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/node-postgres) that will be passed to Drizzle and `node-postgres`.                                                           |\n| `push`                | Disable Drizzle's [`db push`](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview#prototyping-with-db-push) in development mode.

This only works in development mode, and should not be mixed with manually running [`migrate`](../database/migrations) commands.\n\nYou will be warned if any changes that you make will entail data loss while in development mode. Push is enabled by default, but you can opt out if you'd like.\n\nAlternatively, you can disable `push` and rely solely on migrations to keep your local database in sync with your Payload config.\n\n## Migration workflows\n\nIn Postgres, migrations are a fundamental aspect of working with Payload and you should become familiar with how they work.\n\nFor more information about migrations, [click here](../beta/database/migrations#when-to-run-migrations).\n",

      {
        "content": "\nFields are the building blocks of Payload. Both [Collections](../configuration/collections) and [Globals](../configuration/globals) use fields to define the shape of the data that will be stored in the [Database](../database/overview), as well as automatically generate the corresponding UI within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview).\n\nThere are many [Field Types](#field-types) to choose from, ranging anywhere from simple text strings to nested arrays and blocks. Most fields save data to the database, while others are strictly presentational. Fields can have [Custom Validations](#validations), [Conditional Logic](../admin/fields#conditional-logic), [Access Control](#field-level-access-control), [Hooks](#field-level-hooks), and so much more.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  You can fully customize the appearance and behavior of all fields within the Admin Panel. [More details](../admin/fields).\n</Banner>\n\n## Field Types\n\nPayload provides a wide variety of built-in Field Types, each with its own unique properties and behaviors that determine which values it can accept, how it is presented in the API, and how it will be rendered in the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview).\n\nTo configure fields, use the `fields` property in your [Collection](../configuration/collections) or [Global](../configuration/globals) config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Page: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  // highlight-start\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'field',\n      type: 'text',\n    }\n  ]\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  Each field is an object with at least the `type` property. This matches the field to its corresponding Field Type. [More details](#field-options).\n</Banner>\n\nThere are two main categories of fields in Payload:\n\n- [Data Fields](#data-fields)\n- [Presentational Fields](#presentational-fields)\n\nTo begin writing fields, first determine which [Field Type](#field-types) best supports your application. Then to author your field accordingly using the [Field Options](#field-options) for your chosen field type.\n\n### Data Fields\n\nData Fields are used to store data in the [Database](../database/overview). All Data Fields have a `name` property. This is the key that will be used to store the field's value.\n\nHere are the available Data Fields:\n\n- [Array](./array) - for repeating content, supports nested fields\n- [Blocks](./blocks) - for block-based content, supports nested fields\n- [Checkbox](./checkbox) - saves boolean true / false values\n- [Code](./code) - renders a code editor interface that saves a string\n- [Date](./date) - renders a date picker and saves a timestamp\n- [Email](./email) - ensures the value is a properly formatted email address\n- [Group](./group) - nests fields within a keyed object\n- [JSON](./json) - renders a JSON editor interface that saves a JSON object\n- [Number](./number) - saves numeric values\n- [Point](./point) - for location data, saves geometric coordinates\n- [Radio](./radio) - renders a radio button group that allows only one value to be selected\n- [Relationship](./relationship) - assign relationships to other collections\n- [Rich Text](./rich-text) - renders a fully extensible rich text editor\n- [Select](./select) - renders a dropdown / picklist style value selector\n- [Tabs (Named)](./tabs) - similar to group, but renders nested fields within a tabbed layout\n- [Text](./text) - simple text input that saves a string\n- [Textarea](./textarea) - similar to text, but allows for multi-line input\n- [Upload](./upload) - allows local file and image upload\n\n### Presentational Fields\n\nPresentational Fields do not store data in the database. Instead, they are used to organize and present other fields in the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), or to add custom UI components.\n\nHere are the available Presentational Fields:\n\n- [Collapsible](../fields/collapsible) - nests fields within a collapsible component\n- [Row](../fields/row) - aligns fields horizontally\n- [Tabs (Unnamed)](../fields/tabs) - nests fields within a tabbed layout\n- [UI](../fields/ui) - blank field for custom UI components\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  Don't see a Field Type that fits your needs? You can build your own using a [Custom Field Component](../admin/fields#the-field-component).\n</Banner>\n\n## Field Options\n\nAll fields require at least the `type` property. This matches the field to its corresponding [Field Type](#field-types) to determine its appearance and behavior within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). Each Field Type has its own unique set of options based on its own type.\n\nTo set a field's type, use the `type` property in your Field Config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text', // highlight-line\n  name: 'myField',\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  For a full list of configuration options, see the documentation for each [Field Type](#field-types).\n</Banner>\n\n### Field Names\n\nAll [Data Fields](#data-fields) require a `name` property. This is the key that will be used to store and retrieve the field's value in the database. This property must be unique within the Collection, Global, or nested group that it is defined in.\n\nTo set a field's name, use the `name` property in your Field Config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text',\n  name: 'myField', // highlight-line\n}\n```\n\nPayload reserves various field names for internal use. Using reserved field names will result in your field being sanitized from the config.\n\nThe following field names are forbidden and cannot be used:\n\n  - `__v`\n  - `salt`\n  - `hash`\n\n### Field-level Hooks\n\nIn addition to being able to define [Hooks](../hooks/overview) on a document-level, you can define extremely granular logic field-by-field.\n\nTo define Field-level Hooks, use the `hooks` property in your Field Config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text',\n  name: 'myField',\n  // highlight-start\n  hooks: {\n    // ...\n  }\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\nFor full details on Field-level Hooks, see the [Field Hooks](../hooks/fields) documentation.\n\n### Field-level Access Control\n\nIn addition to being able to define [Access Control](../access-control/overview) on a document-level, you can define extremely granular permissions field-by-field.\n\nTo define Field-level Access Control, use the `access` property in your Field Config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text',\n  name: 'myField',\n  // highlight-start\n  access: {\n    // ...\n  }\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\nFor full details on Field-level Access Control, see the [Field Access Control](../access-control/fields) documentation.\n\n### Default Values\n\nFields can be optionally prefilled with initial values. This is used in both the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) as well as API requests to populate missing or undefined field values during the `create` or `update` operations.\n\nTo set a field's default value, use the `defaultValue` property in your Field Config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text',\n  name: 'myField',\n  defaultValue: 'Hello, World!', // highlight-line\n}\n```\n\nDefault values can be defined as a static string or a function that returns a string. Functions are called with the following arguments:\n\n- `user` - the authenticated user object\n- `locale` - the currently selected locale string\n\nHere is an example of a `defaultValue` function:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nconst translation: {\n  en: 'Written by'\n  es: 'Escrito por'\n}\n\nexport const myField: Field = {\n  name: 'attribution',\n  type: 'text',\n  // highlight-start\n  defaultValue: ({ user, locale }) =>\n    `${translation[locale]} ${user.name}`,\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  You can use async `defaultValue` functions to fill fields with data from API requests.\n</Banner>\n\n### Validations\n\nFields are automatically validated based on their [Field Type](#field-types) and other [Field Options](#field-options) such as `required` or `min` and `max` value constraints. If needed, however, field validations can be customized or entirely replaced by providing your own custom validation functions.\n\nTo set a custom field validation function, use the `validate` property in your Field Config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text',\n  name: 'myField',\n  validate: value => Boolean(value) || 'This field is required' // highlight-line\n}\n```\n\nCustom validation functions should return either `true` or a `string` representing the error message to display in API responses.\n\nThe following arguments are provided to the `validate` function:\n\n| Argument | Description                                                                                   |\n| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `value`  | The value of the field being validated.                                                        |\n| `ctx`   | An object with additional data and context. [More details](#validation-context) |\n\n#### Validation Context\n\nThe `ctx` argument contains full document data, sibling field data, the current operation, and other useful information such as currently authenticated in user:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text',\n  name: 'myField',\n  // highlight-start\n  validate: (val, { user }) =>\n    Boolean(user) || 'You must be logged in to save this field',\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\nThe following additional properties are provided in the `ctx` object:\n\n| Property      | Description                                                                                                              |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `data`        | An object containing the full collection or global document currently being edited.                                       |\n| `siblingData` | An object containing document data that is scoped to only fields within the same parent of this field.                    |\n| `operation`   | Will be `create` or `update` depending on the UI action or API call.                                                      |\n| `id`          | The `id` of the current document being edited. `id` is `undefined` during the `create` operation.                         |\n| `req`        | The current HTTP request object. Contains `payload`, `user`, etc. |\n\n#### Reusing Default Field Validations\n\nWhen using custom validation functions, Payload will use yours in place of the default. However, you might want to simply augment the default validation with your own custom logic.\n\nTo reuse default field validations, call them from within your custom validation function:\n\n```ts\nimport { text } from 'payload/fields/validations'\n\nconst field: Field = {\n  name: 'notBad',\n  type: 'text',\n  validate: (val, args) => {\n    if (val === 'bad') return 'This cannot be \"bad\"'\n    return text(val, args) // highlight-line\n  },\n}\n```\n\n#### Async Field Validations\n\nCustom validation functions can also be asynchronous depending on your needs. This makes it possible to make requests to external services or perform other miscellaneous asynchronous logic.\n\nTo write asynchronous validation functions, use the `async` keyword to define your function:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Orders: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'orders',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'customerNumber',\n      type: 'text',\n      // highlight-start\n      validate: async (val, { operation }) => {\n        if (operation !== 'create') return true\n        const response = await fetch(`https://your-api.com/customers/${val}`)\n        if (response.ok) return true\n        return 'The customer number provided does not match any customers within our records.'\n      },\n      // highlight-end\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Admin Options\n\nIn addition to each field's base configuration, you can use the `admin` key to specify traits and properties for fields that will only effect how they are _rendered_ within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), such as their appearance or behavior.\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyField: Field = {\n  type: 'text',\n  name: 'myField',\n  admin: { // highlight-line\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor full details on Admin Options, see the [Field Admin Options](../admin/fields) documentation.\n\n## Custom ID Fields\n\nAll [Collections](../configuration/collections) automatically generate their own ID field. If needed, you can override this behavior by providing an explicit ID field to your config. This will force users to provide a their own ID value when creating a record.\n\nTo define a custom ID field, add a new field with the `name` property set to `id`:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'id', // highlight-line\n      type: 'number',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  The Custom ID Fields can only be of type [`Number`](./number) or [`Text`](./text).\n</Banner>\n\n## TypeScript\n\nYou can import the Payload `Field` type as well as other common types from the `payload` package. [More details](../typescript/overview).\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n```\n",

To do so, you can import and use Payload's `Block` type:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Block } from 'payload/types'\n```\n",

By providing a schema in your field config, the editor will be guided in the admin UI, getting typeahead for properties and their formats automatically. When the document is saved, the default validation will prevent saving any invalid data in the field according to the schema in your config.\n\nIf you only provide a URL to a schema, Payload will fetch the desired schema if it is publicly available. If not, it is recommended to add the schema directly to your config or import it from another file so that it can be implemented consistently in your project.\n\n\n### Local JSON Schema\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'customerJSON', // required\n      type: 'json', // required\n      jsonSchema: {\n        uri: 'a://b/foo.json', // required\n        fileMatch: ['a://b/foo.json'], // required\n        schema: {\n          type: 'object',\n          properties: {\n            foo: {\n              enum: ['bar', 'foobar'],\n            }\n          },\n        },\n      },\n\n    },\n  ],\n}\n// {\"foo\": \"bar\"} or {\"foo\": \"foobar\"} - ok\n// Attempting to create {\"foo\": \"not-bar\"} will throw an error\n```\n\n### Remote JSON Schema\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'customerJSON', // required\n      type: 'json', // required\n      jsonSchema: {\n        uri: 'https://example.com/customer.schema.json', // required\n        fileMatch: ['https://example.com/customer.schema.json'], // required\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n// If 'https://example.com/customer.schema.json' has a JSON schema\n// {\"foo\": \"bar\"} or {\"foo\": \"foobar\"} - ok\n// Attempting to create {\"foo\": \"not-bar\"} will throw an error\n```\n",

The full date is always stored in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` (e.g. `1999-01-01T8:00:00.000+05:00`).\n\n`displayFormat` determines how the date is presented in the field **cell**, you can pass any valid (unicode date format)[https://date-fns.org/v2.29.3/docs/format].\n\n`pickerAppearance` sets the appearance of the **react datepicker**, the options available are `dayAndTime`, `dayOnly`, `timeOnly`, and `monthOnly`. By default, the datepicker will display `dayOnly`.\n\nWhen only `pickerAppearance` is set, an equivalent format will be rendered in the date field cell. To overwrite this format, set `displayFormat`.\n\n## Example\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'dateOnly',\n      type: 'date',\n      admin: {\n        date: {\n          pickerAppearance: 'dayOnly',\n          displayFormat: 'd MMM yyy',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'timeOnly',\n      type: 'date',\n      admin: {\n        date: {\n          pickerAppearance: 'timeOnly',\n          displayFormat: 'h:mm:ss a',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'monthOnly',\n      type: 'date',\n      admin: {\n        date: {\n          pickerAppearance: 'monthOnly',\n          displayFormat: 'MMMM yyyy',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n",

This can be particularly useful for ensuring that the most relevant options are presented first to the user.\n\nYou can specify `sortOptions` in two ways:\n\n**As a string:**\n\nProvide a string to define a global default sort field for all relationship field dropdowns across different\ncollections. You can prefix the field name with a minus symbol (\"-\") to sort in descending order.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nsortOptions: 'fieldName',\n```\n\nThis configuration will sort all relationship field dropdowns by `\"fieldName\"` in ascending order.\n\n**As an object :**\n\nSpecify an object where keys are collection slugs and values are strings representing the field names to sort by. This\nallows for different sorting fields for each collection's relationship dropdown.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nsortOptions: {\n  \"pages\"\n:\n  \"fieldName1\",\n    \"posts\"\n:\n  \"-fieldName2\",\n    \"categories\"\n:\n  \"fieldName3\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this configuration:\n\n- Dropdowns related to `pages` will be sorted by `\"fieldName1\"` in ascending order.\n- Dropdowns for `posts` will use `\"fieldName2\"` for sorting in descending order (noted by the \"-\" prefix).\n- Dropdowns associated with `categories` will sort based on `\"fieldName3\"` in ascending order.\n\nNote: If `sortOptions` is not defined, the default sorting behavior of the Relationship field dropdown will be used.\n\n## Filtering relationship options\n\nOptions can be dynamically limited by supplying a [query constraint](../queries/overview), which will be used both\nfor validating input and filtering available relationships in the UI.\n\nThe `filterOptions` property can either be a `Where` query, or a function returning `true` to not filter, `false` to\nprevent all, or a `Where` query. When using a function, it will be\ncalled with an argument object with the following properties:\n\n| Property      | Description                                                                                           |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `relationTo`  | The collection `slug` to filter against, limited to this field's `relationTo` property                |\n| `data`        | An object containing the full collection or global document currently being edited                    |\n| `siblingData` | An object containing document data that is scoped to only fields within the same parent of this field |\n| `id`          | The `id` of the current document being edited. `id` is `undefined` during the `create` operation      |\n| `user`        | An object containing the currently authenticated user                                                 |\n\n## Example\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'purchase',\n      type: 'relationship',\n      relationTo: ['products', 'services'],\n      filterOptions: ({ relationTo, siblingData }) => {\n        // returns a Where query dynamically by the type of relationship\n        if (relationTo === 'products') {\n          return {\n            stock: { greater_than: siblingData.quantity },\n          }\n        }\n\n        if (relationTo === 'services') {\n          return {\n            isAvailable: { equals: true },\n          }\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn more about writing queries [here](../queries/overview).\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When a relationship field has both <strong>filterOptions</strong> and a custom{' '}\n  <strong>validate</strong> function, the api will not validate <strong>filterOptions</strong>{' '}\n  unless you call the default relationship field validation function imported from{' '}\n  <strong>payload/fields/validations</strong> in your validate function.\n</Banner>\n\n## How the data is saved\n\nGiven the variety of options possible within the `relationship` field type, the shape of the data needed for creating\nand updating these fields can vary. The following sections will describe the variety of data shapes that can arise from\nthis field.\n\n### Has One\n\nThe most simple pattern of a relationship is to use `hasMany: false` with a `relationTo` that allows for only one type\nof collection.\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owner', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: 'users', // required\n      hasMany: false,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe shape of the data to save for a document with the field configured this way would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  // ObjectID of the related user\n  \"owner\": \"6031ac9e1289176380734024\"\n}\n```\n\nWhen querying documents in this collection via REST API, you could query as follows:\n\n`?where[owner][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\n### Has One - Polymorphic\n\nAlso known as **dynamic references**, in this configuration, the `relationTo` field is an array of Collection slugs that\ntells Payload which Collections are valid to reference.\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owner', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: ['users', 'organizations'], // required\n      hasMany: false,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe shape of the data to save for a document with more than one relationship type would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"owner\": {\n    \"relationTo\": \"organizations\",\n    \"value\": \"6031ac9e1289176380734024\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example for how to query documents by this data (note the difference in referencing the `owner.value`):\n\n`?where[owner.value][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\nYou can also query for documents where a field has a relationship to a specific Collection:\n\n`?where[owners.relationTo][equals]=organizations`.\n\nThis query would return only documents that have an owner relationship to organizations.\n\n### Has Many\n\nThe `hasMany` tells Payload that there may be more than one collection saved to the field.\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owners', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: 'users', // required\n      hasMany: true,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo save the to `hasMany` relationship field we need to send an array of IDs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"owners\": [\"6031ac9e1289176380734024\", \"602c3c327b811235943ee12b\"]\n}\n```\n\nWhen querying documents, the format does not change for arrays:\n\n`?where[owners][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\n### Has Many - Polymorphic\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owners', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: ['users', 'organizations'], // required\n      hasMany: true,\n      required: true,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nRelationship fields with `hasMany` set to more than one kind of collections save their data as an array of objects—each\ncontaining the Collection `slug` as the `relationTo` value, and the related document `id` for the `value`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"owners\": [\n    {\n      \"relationTo\": \"users\",\n      \"value\": \"6031ac9e1289176380734024\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"relationTo\": \"organizations\",\n      \"value\": \"602c3c327b811235943ee12b\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nQuerying is done in the same way as the earlier Polymorphic example:\n\n`?where[owners.value][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\n### Querying and Filtering Polymorphic Relationships\n\nPolymorphic and non-polymorphic relationships must be queried differently because of how the related data is stored and\nmay be inconsistent across different collections. Because of this, filtering polymorphic relationship fields from the\nCollection List admin UI is limited to the `id` value.\n\nFor a polymorphic relationship, the response will always be an array of objects. Each object will contain\nthe `relationTo` and `value` properties.\n\nThe data can be queried by the related document ID:\n\n`?where[field.value][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\nOr by the related document Collection slug:\n\n`?where[field.relationTo][equals]=your-collection-slug`.\n\nHowever, you **cannot** query on any field values within the related document.\nSince we are referencing multiple collections, the field you are querying on may not exist and break the query.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  You <strong>cannot</strong> query on a field within a polymorphic relationship as you would with a\n  non-polymorphic relationship.\n</Banner>\n",

(Only works when `hasMany` is set to `true`)\n\n## Example\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'selectedFeatures', // required\n      type: 'select', // required\n      hasMany: true,\n      admin: {\n        isClearable: true,\n        isSortable: true, // use mouse to drag and drop different values, and sort them according to your choice\n      },\n      options: [\n        {\n          label: 'Metallic Paint',\n          value: 'metallic_paint',\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Alloy Wheels',\n          value: 'alloy_wheels',\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Carbon Fiber Dashboard',\n          value: 'carbon_fiber_dashboard',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nThe Select field UI component can be customized by providing a custom React component to the `components` object in the Base config.\n\n```ts\nexport const CustomSelectField: Field = {\n  name: 'customSelectField',\n  type: 'select', // or 'text' if you have dynamic options\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      Field: CustomSelectComponent({\n        options: [\n          {\n            label: 'Option 1',\n            value: '1',\n          },\n          {\n            label: 'Option 2',\n            value: '2',\n          },\n        ],\n      }),\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can import the existing Select component directly from Payload, then extend and customize it as needed.\n\n```ts\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { SelectInput, useField } from 'payload/components/forms';\nimport { useAuth } from 'payload/components/utilities';\n\ntype CustomSelectProps = {\n  path: string;\n  options: {\n    label: string;\n    value: string;\n  }[];\n}\n\nexport const CustomSelectComponent: React.FC<CustomSelectProps> = ({ path, options }) => {\n  const { value, setValue } = useField<string>({ path })\n  const { user } = useAuth()\n\n  const adjustedOptions = options.filter((option) => {\n    /*\n      A common use case for a custom select\n      is to show different options based on\n      the current user's role.\n    */\n    return option;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <label className=\"field-label\">\n        Custom Select\n      </label>\n      <SelectInput\n        path={path}\n        name={path}\n        options={adjustedOptions}\n        value={value}\n        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you are looking to create a dynamic select field, the following tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a custom select field that fetches its options from an external API.\n\n<VideoDrawer\n  id=\"Efn9OxSjA6Y\"\n  label=\"How to Create a Custom Select Field\"\n  drawerTitle=\"How to Create a Custom Select Field: A Step-by-Step Guide\"\n/>\n\nIf you want to learn more about custom components check out the [Admin > Custom Component](../admin/components#field-component) docs.\n",

      {
        "content": "\nPayload dynamically generates a beautiful, [fully type-safe](../typescript/overview) admin panel to manage your users and data. It is highly performant, even with 100+ fields, and is translated in over 30 languages. Within the Admin Panel you can manage content, [render your site](../live-preview/overview), preview drafts, [diff versions](../versions/overview), and so much more.\n\nThe Admin Panel is designed to [white-label your brand](https://payloadcms.com/blog/white-label-admin-ui). You can endlessly customize and extend the Admin UI by swapping in your own [Custom Components](./components)—everything from simple field labels to entire views can be modified or replaced to perfectly tailor the interface for your editors.\n\nThe Admin Panel is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and built with [React](https://react.dev) using the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). It supports [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), enabling the use of the [Local API](../local-api/overview) on the front-end. You can install Payload into any [existing Next.js app in just one line](../getting-started/installation) and [deploy it anywhere](../production).\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  The Payload Admin Panel is designed to be as minimal and straightforward as possible to allow easy customization and control. [Learn more](./components).\n</Banner>\n\n<LightDarkImage\n  srcLight=\"https://payloadcms.com/images/docs/admin.jpg\"\n  srcDark=\"https://payloadcms.com/images/docs/admin-dark.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Admin Panel with collapsible sidebar\"\n  caption=\"Redesigned Admin Panel with a collapsible sidebar that's open by default, providing greater extensibility and enhanced horizontal real estate.\"\n/>\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe Admin Panel serves as the entire HTTP layer for Payload, providing a full CRUD interface for your app. This means that both the [REST](../rest-api/overview) and [GraphQL](../graphql/overview) APIs are simply [Next.js Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) that exist directly alongside your front-end application.\n\nOnce you [install Payload](../getting-started/installation), the following files and directories will be created in your app:\n\n```plaintext\napp/\n├─ (payload)/\n├── admin/\n├─── [[...segments]]/\n├──── page.tsx\n├──── not-found.tsx\n├── api/\n├─── [...slug]/\n├──── route.ts\n├── graphql/\n├──── route.ts\n├── graphql-playground/\n├──── route.ts\n├── custom.scss\n├── layout.tsx\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  If you are not familiar with Next.js project structure, you can [learn more about it here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure).\n</Banner>\n\nAs shown above, all Payload routes are nested within the `(payload)` route group. This creates a boundary between the Admin Panel and the rest of your application by scoping all layouts and styles. The `layout.tsx` file within this directory, for example, is where Payload manages the `html` tag of the document to set proper [`lang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) and [`dir`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir) attributes, etc.\n\nThe `admin` directory contains all the _pages_ related to the interface itself, whereas the `api` and `graphql` directories contains all the _routes_ related to the [REST API](../rest-api/overview) and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview). All admin routes are [easily configurable](#customizing-routes) to meet your application's exact requirements.\n\nFinally, the `custom.scss` file is where you can add or override globally-oriented styles in the Admin Panel, such as modify the color palette. Customizing the look and feel through CSS alone is a powerful feature of the Admin Panel, [more on that here](./customizing-css).\n\nAll auto-generated files will contain the following comments at the top of each file:\n\n```tsx\n/* THIS FILE WAS GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY BY PAYLOAD. */,\n/* DO NOT MODIFY IT BECAUSE IT COULD BE REWRITTEN AT ANY TIME. */\n```\n\n## Admin Options\n\nAll options for the Admin Panel are defined in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview) under the `admin` property:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: { // highlight-line\n    // ...\n  },\n})\n```\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| Option            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `user`            | The `slug` of the Collection that you want to allow to login to the Admin Panel.

Any valid [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) format pattern can be used.                                                                                                                             |\n| `avatar`          | Set account profile picture.

You can also customize the admin options for _Collections and Globals_ through their respective `admin` keys.\n</Banner>\n\n### The Admin User Collection\n\nTo specify which Collection to allow to login to the Admin Panel, pass the `admin.user` key equal to the slug of any auth-enabled Collection:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    user: 'admins', // highlight-line\n  },\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The Admin Panel can only be used by a single auth-enabled Collection. To enable authentication for a Collection, simply set `auth: true` in the Collection's configuration. See [Authentication](../authentication/overview) for more information.\n</Banner>\n\nBy default, if you have not specified a Collection, Payload will automatically provide a `User` Collection with access to the Admin Panel. You can customize or override the fields and settings of the default `User` Collection by adding your own Collection with `slug: 'users'`. Doing this will force Payload to use your provided `User` Collection instead of its default version.\n\nYou can use whatever Collection you'd like to access the Admin Panel as long as the Collection supports [Authentication](../authentication/overview). It doesn't need to be called `users`. For example, you may wish to have two Collections that both support authentication:\n\n- `admins` - meant to have a higher level of permissions to manage your data and access the Admin Panel\n- `customers` - meant for end users of your app that should not be allowed to log into the Admin Panel\n\nTo do this, specify `admin: { user: 'admins' }` in your config. This will provide access to the Admin Panel to only `admins`. Any users authenticated as `customers` will be prevented from accessing the Admin Panel.  See [Access Control](../access-control/overview) for full details.\n\n### Role-based Access Control\n\nIt is also possible to allow multiple user types into the Admin Panel with limited permissions. For example, you may wish to have two roles within the `admins` Collection:\n\n- `super-admin` - full access to the Admin Panel to perform any action\n- `editor` - limited access to the Admin Panel to only manage content\n\nTo do this, add a `roles` or similar field to your auth-enabled Collection, then use the `access.admin` property to grant or deny access based on the value of that field. See [Access Control](../access-control/overview) for full details. For a complete, working example of role-based access control, check out the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth/payload).\n\n## Customizing Routes\n\nYou have full control over the routes that Payload binds itself to. This includes both [Root-level Routes](#root-level-routes) such as the [REST API](../rest-api/overview), and [Admin-level Routes](#admin-level-routes) such as the user's account page. You can customize these routes to meet the needs of your application simply by specifying the desired paths in your config.\n\n### Root-level Routes\n\nRoot-level routes are those that are not behind the `/admin` path, such as the [REST API](../rest-api/overview) and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview), or the root path of the Admin Panel itself.\n\nTo customize root-level routes, use the `routes` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  routes: {\n    admin: '/custom-admin-route' // highlight-line\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| Option             | Default route           | Description                           |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| `admin`            | `/admin`                | The Admin Panel itself.               |\n| `api`              | `/api`                  | The [REST API](../rest-api/overview) base path.               |\n| `graphQL`          | `/graphql`              | The [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview) base path.            |\n| `graphQLPlayground`| `/graphql-playground`   | The GraphQL Playground.               |\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  Changing Root-level Routes _after_ your project was generated will also require you to manually update the corresponding directories in your project. For example, changing `routes.admin` will require you to rename the `(payload)/admin` directory in your project to match the new route. [More details](#project-structure).\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n   You can easily add _new_ routes to the Admin Panel through the `endpoints` property of the Payload Config. See [Custom Endpoints](../rest-api/overview#custom-endpoints) for more information.\n</Banner>\n\n### Admin-level Routes\n\nAdmin-level routes are those behind the `/admin` path. These are the routes that are part of the Admin Panel itself, such as the user's account page, the login page, etc.\n\nTo customize admin-level routes, use the `admin.routes` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    routes: {\n      account: '/my-account' // highlight-line\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| Option            | Default route           | Description                                     |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| `account`         | `/account`              | The user's account page.                        |\n| `createFirstUser` | `/create-first-user`    | The page to create the first user.              |\n| `forgot`          | `/forgot`               | The password reset page.                        |\n| `inactivity`      | `/logout-inactivity`    | The page to redirect to after inactivity.       |\n| `login`           | `/login`                | The login page.                                 |\n| `logout`          | `/logout`               | The logout page.                                |\n| `reset`           | `/reset`                | The password reset page.                        |\n| `unauthorized`    | `/unauthorized`         | The unauthorized page.                          |\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  You can also swap out entire _views_ out for your own, using the `admin.views` property of the Payload Config. See [Custom Views](./views) for more information.\n</Banner>\n\n## I18n\n\nThe Payload Admin Panel is translated in over [30 languages and counting](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/packages/translations). Languages are automatically detected based on the user's browser and used by the Admin Panel to display all text in that language. If no language was detected, or if the user's language is not yet supported, English will be chosen. Users can easily specify their language by selecting one from their account page. See [I18n](../configuration/i18n) for more information.\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  If there is a language that Payload does not yet support, we accept code\n  [contributions](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n</Banner>\n\n## Light and Dark Modes\n\nUsers in the Admin Panel have the ability to choose between light mode and dark mode for their editing experience. Users can select their preferred theme from their account page. Once selected, it is saved to their user's preferences and persisted across sessions and devices. If no theme was selected, the Admin Panel will automatically detect the operation system's theme and use that as the default.\n",

        "content": "\nThe Payload [Admin Panel](./overview) is designed to be as minimal and straightforward as possible to allow for both easy customization and full control over the UI. In order for Payload to support this level of customization, Payload provides a pattern for you to supply your own React components through your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview).\n\nAll Custom Components in Payload are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default, with the exception of [Custom Providers](#custom-providers). This enables the use of the [Local API](../local-api) directly on the front-end. Custom Components are available for nearly every part of the Admin Panel for extreme granularity and control.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  Client Components continue to be fully supported. To use Client Components in your app, simply include the `use client` directive. Payload will automatically detect and remove all default, [non-serializable props](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types) before rendering your component. [More details](#client-components).\n</Banner>\n\nThere are four main types of Custom Components in Payload:\n\n- [Root Components](#root-components)\n- [Collection Components](#collection-components)\n- [Global Components](#global-components)\n- [Field Components](./fields)\n\nTo swap in your own Custom Component, consult the list of available components. Determine the scope that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, then [author your React component(s)](#building-custom-components) accordingly.\n\n## Root Components\n\nRoot Components are those that effect the [Admin Panel](./overview) generally, such as the logo or the main nav.\n\nTo override Root Components, use the `admin.components` property in your [Payload Config](../getting-started/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nimport { MyCustomLogo } from './MyCustomLogo'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      graphics: {\n        Logo: MyCustomLogo, // highlight-line\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components)._\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Nav`**             | Contains the sidebar / mobile menu in its entirety.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **`beforeNavLinks`**  | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Nav, _before_ the links themselves.                                                                                                                       |\n| **`afterNavLinks`**   | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Nav, _after_ the links.                                                                                                                                   |\n| **`beforeDashboard`** | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Dashboard, _before_ the default dashboard contents.                                                                                                       |\n| **`afterDashboard`**  | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Dashboard, _after_ the default dashboard contents.                                                                                                        |\n| **`beforeLogin`**     | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Login, _before_ the default login form.                                                                                                                   |\n| **`afterLogin`**      | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Login, _after_ the default login form.                                                                                                                    |\n| **`logout.Button`**   | The button displayed in the sidebar that logs the user out.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| **`graphics.Icon`**   | The simplified logo used in contexts like the the `Nav` component.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| **`graphics.Logo`**   | The full logo used in contexts like the `Login` view.                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **`providers`**       | Custom [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) providers that will wrap the entire [Admin Panel](./overview).

This means that when building Custom Components within the Admin Panel, you do not have to get these yourself.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nconst MyServerComponent = async ({\n  payload // highlight-line\n}) => {\n  const page = await payload.findByID({\n    collection: 'pages',\n    id: '123',\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <p>{page.title}</p>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nEach Custom Component receives the following props by default:\n\n| Prop                      | Description                                                                                           |\n| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `payload`                 | The [Payload](../local-api/overview) class.                                                           |\n| `i18n`                    | The [i18n](../i18n) object.                                                                           |\n\nCustom Components also receive various other props that are specific to the context in which the Custom Component is being rendered. For example, [Custom Views](./views) receive the `user` prop. For a full list of available props, consult the documentation related to the specific component you are working with.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  See [Root Components](#root-components), [Collection Components](#collection-components), [Global Components](#global-components), or [Field Components](#custom-field-components) for a complete list of all available components.\n</Banner>\n\n### Client Components\n\nWhen [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components), it's still possible to use client-side code such as `useState` or the `window` object. To do this, simply add the `use client` directive at the top of your file. Payload will automatically detect and remove all default, [non-serializable props](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types) before rendering your component.\n\n```tsx\n'use client' // highlight-line\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n      Clicked {count} times\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  Client Components cannot be passed [non-serializable props](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types). If you are rendering your Client Component _from within_ a Server Component, ensure that its props are serializable.\n</Banner>\n\n### Accessing the Payload Config\n\nFrom any Server Component, the [Payload Config](../configuration/overview) can be accessed directly from the `payload` prop:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport default async function MyServerComponent({\n  payload: {\n    config // highlight-line\n  }\n}) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={config.serverURL}>\n      Go Home\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBut, the Payload Config is [non-serializable](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types) by design. It is full of custom validation functions, React components, etc. This means that the Payload Config, in its entirety, cannot be passed directly to Client Components.\n\nFor this reason, Payload creates a Client Config and passes it into the Config Provider. This is a serializable version of the Payload Config that can be accessed from any Client Component via the [`useConfig`](./hooks#useconfig) hook:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { useConfig } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nexport const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const { serverURL } = useConfig() // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <Link href={serverURL}>\n      Go Home\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  See [Using Hooks](#using-hooks) for more details.\n</Banner>\n\n### Using Hooks\n\nTo make it easier to [build your Custom Components](#building-custom-components), you can use [Payload's built-in React Hooks](./hooks) in any Client Component. For example, you might want to interact with one of Payload's many React Contexts:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { useDocumentInfo } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nexport const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const { slug } = useDocumentInfo() // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <p>{`Entity slug: ${slug}`}</p>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  See the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for a full list of available hooks.\n</Banner>\n\n### Getting the Current Language\n\nAll Custom Components can support multiple languages to be consistent with Payload's [Internationalization](../configuration/i18n). To do this, first add your translation resources to the [I18n Config](../configuration/i18n).\n\nFrom any Server Component, you can translate resources using the `getTranslation` function from `@payloadcms/translations`. All Server Components automatically receive the `i18n` object as a prop by default.\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { getTranslation } from '@payloadcms/translations'\n\nexport default async function MyServerComponent({ i18n }) {\n  const translatedTitle = getTranslation(myTranslation, i18n) // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <p>{translatedTitle}</p>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe best way to do this within a Client Component is to import the `useTranslation` hook from `@payloadcms/ui`:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { useTranslation } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nexport const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation() // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>{t('namespace1:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>\n      <li>{t('namespace2:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>\n      <li>{i18n.language}</li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  See the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for a full list of available hooks.\n</Banner>\n\n### Getting the Current Locale\n\nAll [Custom Views](./views) can support multiple locales to be consistent with Payload's [Localization](../configuration/localization). They automatically receive the `locale` object as a prop by default. This can be used to scope API requests, etc.:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport default async function MyServerComponent({ payload, locale }) {\n  const localizedPage = await payload.findByID({\n    collection: 'pages',\n    id: '123',\n    locale,\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <p>{localizedPage.title}</p>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe best way to do this within a Client Component is to import the `useLocale` hook from `@payloadcms/ui`:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { useLocale } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst Greeting: React.FC = () => {\n  const locale = useLocale() // highlight-line\n\n  const trans = {\n    en: 'Hello',\n    es: 'Hola',\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <span>{trans[locale.code]}</span>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  See the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for a full list of available hooks.\n</Banner>\n\n### Styling Custom Components\n\nPayload has a robust [CSS Library](./customizing-css) that you can use to style your Custom Components similarly to Payload's built-in styling. This will ensure that your Custom Components match the existing design system, and so that they automatically adapt to any theme changes that might occur.\n\nTo apply custom styles, simply import your own `.css` or `.scss` file into your Custom Component:\n\n```tsx\nimport './index.scss'\n\nexport const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"my-component\">\n      My Custom Component\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThen to colorize your Custom Component's background, for example, you can use the following CSS:\n\n```scss\n.my-component {\n  background-color: var(--theme-elevation-500);\n}\n```\n\nPayload also exports its [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) library for reuse which includes mixins, etc. To use this, simply import it as follows into your `.scss` file:\n\n```scss\n@import '~@payloadcms/ui/scss';\n\n.my-component {\n  @include mid-break {\n    background-color: var(--theme-elevation-900);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  You can also drill into Payload's own component styles, or easily apply global, app-wide CSS. More on that [here](./customizing-css).\n</Banner>\n",

        "content": "\nViews are the individual pages that make up the [Admin Panel](./overview), such as the Dashboard, List, and Edit views. One of the most powerful ways to customize the Admin Panel is to create Custom Views. These are [Custom Components](./components) that can either replace built-in views or can be entirely new.\n\nWithin the Admin Panel, there are four types of views:\n\n- [Root Views](#root-views)\n- [Collection Views](#collection-views)\n- [Global Views](#global-views)\n- [Document Views](#document-views)\n\nTo swap in your own Custom Views, consult the list of available components. Determine the scope that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, then [author your React component(s)](#building-custom-views) accordingly.\n\n## Root Views\n\nRoot Views are the main views of the [Admin Panel](./overview). These are views that are scoped directly under the `/admin` route, such as the Dashboard or Account views.\n\nTo easily swap Root Views with your own, or to [create entirely new ones](#adding-new-root-views), use the `admin.components.views` property of your root [Payload Config](../configuration/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Dashboard: MyCustomDashboardView, // highlight-line\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Views, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views)._\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| Property        | Description                                                                   |\n| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Account`**   | The Account view is used to show the currently logged in user's Account page. |\n| **`Dashboard`** | The main landing page of the [Admin Panel](./overview).                                     |\n\nFor more granular control, pass a configuration object instead. Payload exposes the following properties for each view:\n\n| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **`Component`** \\* | Pass in the component that should be rendered when a user navigates to this route.                                                                                                         |\n| **`path`** \\*      | Any valid URL path or array of paths that [`path-to-regexp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regex) understands.                                                                     |\n| **`exact`**        | Boolean. When true, will only match if the path matches the `usePathname()` exactly.                                                                                                     |\n| **`strict`**       | When true, a path that has a trailing slash will only match a `location.pathname` with a trailing slash. This has no effect when there are additional URL segments in the pathname. |\n| **`sensitive`**    | When true, will match if the path is case sensitive.                                                                                                                                       |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n### Adding New Views\n\nTo add a _new_ views to the [Admin Panel](./overview), simply add your own key to the `views` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. For example:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        // highlight-start\n        MyCustomView: {\n        // highlight-end\n          Component: MyCustomView,\n          path: '/my-custom-view',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nThe above example shows how to add a new [Root View](#root-views), but the pattern is the same for [Collection Views](#collection-views), [Global Views](#global-views), and [Document Views](#document-views). For help on how to build your own Custom Views, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views).\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Routes are cascading, so unless explicitly given the `exact` property, they will\n  match on URLs that simply _start_ with the route's path. This is helpful when creating catch-all\n  routes in your application. Alternatively, define your nested route _before_ your parent\n  route.\n</Banner>\n\n## Collection Views\n\nCollection Views are views that are scoped under the `/collections` route, such as the Collection List and Document Edit views.\n\nTo easily swap out Collection Views with your own, or to [create entirely new ones](#adding-new-views), use the `admin.components.views` property of your [Collection Config](../collections/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyCollectionConfig: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: MyCustomEditView, // highlight-line\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Views, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views)._\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  The `Edit` property will replace the _entire_ Edit View, including the title, tabs, etc., _as well as all nested [Document Views](#document-views)_, such as the API, Live Preview, and Version views.

All Document Views keep their overall structure across navigation changes, such as their title and tabs, and replace only the content below.\n\nTo easily swap out Document Views with your own, or to [create entirely new ones](#adding-new-document-views), use the `admin.components.views.Edit[key]` property in your [Collection Config](../collections/overview) or [Global Config](../globals/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyCollectionOrGlobalConfig: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: {\n          API: {\n            Component: MyCustomAPIView, // highlight-line\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Views, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views)._\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n <strong>Note:</strong>\n If you need to replace the _entire_ Edit View, including _all_ nested Document Views, use the `Edit` key itself.

[More details](../versions).                    |\n| **`Version`**     | The Version view is used to view a single version of a single document for a given collection. [More details](../versions). |\n| **`API`**         | The API view is used to display the REST API JSON response for a given document.                                            |\n| **`LivePreview`** | The LivePreview view is used to display the Live Preview interface.

Tabs are highly configurable, from as simple as changing the label to swapping out the entire component, they can be modified in any way. To add or customize tabs in the Edit View, use the `Component.Tab` key:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'my-collection',\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: {\n          MyCustomTab: {\n            Component: MyCustomTab,\n            path: '/my-custom-tab',\n            Tab: MyCustomTab // highlight-line\n          },\n          AnotherCustomView: {\n            Component: AnotherCustomView,\n            path: '/another-custom-view',\n            // highlight-start\n            Tab: {\n              label: 'Another Custom View',\n              href: '/another-custom-view',\n            }\n            // highlight-end\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n <strong>Note:</strong>\n This applies to _both_ Collections _and_ Globals.\n</Banner>\n\n## Building Custom Views\n\nCustom Views are just [Custom Components](./components) rendered at the page-level. To understand how to build Custom Views, first review the [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components) guide. Once you have a Custom Component ready, you can use it as a Custom View.\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\nimport { MyCustomView } from './MyCustomView'\n\nexport const MyCollectionConfig: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: MyCustomView, // highlight-line\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYour Custom Views will be provided with the following props:\n\n| Prop                      | Description                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |                                                                                            |\n| **`user`**                    | The currently logged in user.                                                                                                          |\n| **`locale`**                  | The current [Locale](../configuration/localization) of the [Admin Panel](./overview).                                                  |\n| **`navGroups`**               | The grouped navigation items according to `admin.group` in your [Collection Config](../collections/overview) or [Global Config](../globals/overview). |\n| **`params`**                  | An object containing the [Dynamic Route Parameters](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).     |\n| **`permissions`**             | The permissions of the currently logged in user.                                                                                       |\n| **`searchParams`**            | An object containing the [Search Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).      |\n| **`visibleEntities`**         | The current user's visible entities according to your [Access Control](../access-control/overview).                                    |\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  All [Custom Server Components](./components) receive `payload` and `i18n` by default.

Fields are designed to withstand heavy modification or even complete replacement through the use of [Custom Field Components](#field-components), [Conditional Logic](#conditional-logic), [Custom Validations](../fields/overview#validation), and more.\n\nFor example, your app might need to render a specific interface that Payload does not inherently support, such as a color picker. To do this, you could replace the default [Text Field](../fields/text) input with your own user-friendly component that formats the data into a valid color value.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  Don't see a built-in field type that you need? Build it! Using a combination of [Field Validations](../fields/overview#validation)\n  and [Custom Components](./components), you can override the entirety of how a component functions within the [Admin Panel](./overview) to effectively create your own field type.\n</Banner>\n\n## Admin Options\n\nYou can customize the appearance and behavior of fields within the [Admin Panel](./overvieW) through the `admin` property of any [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const CollectionConfig: CollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  fields: [\n    // ...\n    {\n      name: 'myField',\n      type: 'text',\n      admin: { // highlight-line\n        // ...\n      },\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`condition`**         | Programmatically show / hide fields based on other fields.

This is the input that user's will interact with when editing a document.\n\nTo easily swap in your own Field Component, use the `admin.components.Field` property in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const CollectionConfig: CollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  fields: [\n    // ...\n    {\n      // ...\n      admin: {\n        components: {\n          Field: MyFieldComponent, // highlight-line\n        },\n      },\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components)._\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Instead of replacing the entire Field Component, you can alternately replace or slot-in only specific parts by using the [`Label`](#the-label-component), [`Error`](#the-error-component), [`beforeInput`](#afterinput-and-beforinput), and [`afterInput`](#afterinput-and-beforinput) properties.\n</Banner>\n\nAll Field Components receive the following props:\n\n| Property         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`AfterInput`** | The rendered result of the `admin.components.afterInput` property.

See [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components) for more details.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Sending and receiving values from the form\n\nWhen swapping out the `Field` component, you are responsible for sending and receiving the field's `value` from the form itself.\n\nTo do so, import the [`useField`](./hooks#usefield) hook from `@payloadcms/ui` and use it to manage the field's value:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useField } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nexport const CustomTextField: React.FC = () => {\n  const { value, setValue } = useField() // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <input\n      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}\n      value={value}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  For a complete list of all available React hooks, see the [Payload React Hooks](./hooks) documentation. For additional help, see [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components).\n</Banner>\n\n### The Cell Component\n\nThe Cell Component is rendered in the table of the List View. It represents the value of the field when displayed in a table cell.\n\nTo easily swap in your own Cell Component, use the `admin.components.Cell` property in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const myField: Field = {\n  name: 'myField',\n  type: 'text',\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      Cell: MyCustomCell, // highlight-line\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components)._\n\nAll Cell Components receive the following props:\n\n| Property         | Description                                                       |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`name`** | The name of the field. |\n| **`className`**  | The `admin.className` property defined in the [Field Config](../fields/overview). |\n| **`fieldType`** | The `type` property defined in the [Field Config](../fields/overview). |\n| **`schemaPath`** | The path to the field in the schema. Similar to `path`, but without dynamic indices. |\n| **`isFieldAffectingData`** | A boolean value that represents if the field is affecting the data or not. |\n| **`label`** | The label value provided in the field, it can be used with i18n. |\n| **`labels`** | An object that contains the labels for the field. |\n| **`link`** | A boolean representing whether this cell should be wrapped in a link. |\n| **`onClick`** | A function that is called when the cell is clicked. |\n| **`dateDisplayFormat`** | If a [`date`](../fields/date) field, the `admin.dateDisplayFormat` property defined in the [Field Config](../fields/overview). |\n| **`options`** | If a [`select`](../fields/select) field, this is an array of options defined in the [Field Config](../fields/overview). [More details](../fields/select). |\n| **`relationTo`** | If a [`relationship`](../fields/relationship). or [`upload`](../fields/upload) field, this is the collection(s) the field is related to. |\n| **`richTextComponentMap`** | If a [`richText`](../fields/rich-text) field, this is an object that maps the rich text components. [More details](../fields/rich-text). |\n| **`blocks`** | If a [`blocks`](../fields/blocks) field, this is an array of labels and slugs representing the blocks defined in the [Field Config](../fields/overview). [More details](../fields/blocks). |\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  Use the [`useTableCell`](./hooks#usetablecell) hook to subscribe to the field's `cellData` and `rowData`.\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  All [Custom Server Components](./components) receive the `payload` and `i18n` properties by default. See [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components) for more details.\n</Banner>\n\n### The Label Component\n\nThe Label Component is rendered anywhere a field needs to be represented by a label. This is typically used in the Edit View, but can also be used in the List View and elsewhere.\n\nTo easily swap in your own Label Component, use the `admin.components.Label` property in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const myField: Field = {\n  name: 'myField',\n  type: 'text',\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      Label: MyCustomLabel, // highlight-line\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components)._\n\nAll Label Components receive the following props:\n\n| Property       | Description                                                      |\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`label`**    | Label value provided in field, it can be used with i18n.         |\n| **`required`** | The `admin.required` property defined in the [Field Config](../fields/overview). |\n| **`schemaPath`** | The path to the field in the schema. Similar to `path`, but without dynamic indices. |\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  All [Custom Server Components](./components) receive the `payload` and `i18n` properties by default. See [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components) for more details.\n</Banner>\n\n### The Error Component\n\nThe Error Component is rendered when a field fails validation. It is typically displayed beneath the field input in a visually-compelling style.\n\nTo easily swap in your own Error Component, use the `admin.components.Error` property in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nexport const myField: Field = {\n  name: 'myField',\n  type: 'text',\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      Error: MyCustomError, // highlight-line\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components)._\n\nAll Error Components receive the following props:\n\n| Property        | Description                                                   |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`path`***       | The static path of the field at render time. [More details](./hooks#usefieldprops). |\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  All [Custom Server Components](./components) receive the `payload` and `i18n` properties by default. See [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components) for more details.\n</Banner>\n\n### The Description Property\n\nField Descriptions are used to provide additional information to the editor about a field, such as special instructions. Their placement varies from field to field, but typically are displayed with subtle style differences beneath the field inputs.\n\nA description can be configured in three ways:\n\n  - As a string.\n  - As a function which returns a string. [More details](#description-functions).\n  - As a React component. [More details](#the-description-component).\n\nTo easily add a Custom Description to a field, use the `admin.description` property in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyCollectionConfig: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  fields: [\n    // ...\n    {\n      name: 'myField',\n      type: 'text',\n      admin: {\n        description: 'Hello, world!' // highlight-line\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  To replace the Field Description with a [Custom Component](./components), use the `admin.components.Description` property. [More details](#the-description-component).\n</Banner>\n\n#### Description Functions\n\nCustom Descriptions can also be defined as a function. Description Functions are executed on the server and can be used to format simple descriptions based on the user's current [Locale](../configuration/localization).\n\nTo easily add a Description Function to a field, set the `admin.description` property to a _function_ in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyCollectionConfig: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  fields: [\n    // ...\n    {\n      name: 'myField',\n      type: 'text',\n      admin: {\n        description: ({ t }) => `${t('Hello, world!')}` // highlight-line\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAll Description Functions receive the following arguments:\n\n| Argument       | Description                                                      |\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`t`**        | The `t` function used to internationalize the Admin Panel. [More details](../configuration/i18n) |\n\n### The Description Component\n\nAlternatively to the [Description Property](#the-description-property), you can also use a [Custom Component](./components) as the Field Description. This can be useful when you need to provide more complex feedback to the user, such as rendering dynamic field values or other interactive elements.\n\nTo easily add a Description Component to a field, use the `admin.components.Description` property in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\nimport { MyCustomDescription } from './MyCustomDescription'\n\nexport const MyCollectionConfig: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  fields: [\n    // ...\n    {\n      name: 'myField',\n      type: 'text',\n      admin: {\n        components: {\n          Description: MyCustomDescription, // highlight-line\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n_For details on how to build a Custom Description, see [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components)._\n\nAll Description Components receive the following props:\n\n| Property       | Description                                                      |\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`description`**    | The `description` property defined in the [Field Config](../fields/overview).         |\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  All [Custom Server Components](./components) receive the `payload` and `i18n` properties by default. See [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components) for more details.\n</Banner>\n\n### afterInput and beforeInput\n\nWith these properties you can add multiple components _before_ and _after_ the input element, as their name suggests. This is useful when you need to render additional elements alongside the field without replacing the entire field component.\n\nTo add components before and after the input element, use the `admin.components.beforeInput` and `admin.components.afterInput` properties in your [Field Config](../fields/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const MyCollectionConfig: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  // ...\n  fields: [\n    // ...\n    {\n      name: 'myField',\n      type: 'text',\n      admin: {\n        components: {\n          // highlight-start\n          beforeInput: [MyCustomComponent],\n          afterInput: [MyOtherCustomComponent],\n          // highlight-end\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n_For details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](./components#building-custom-components)._\n\n## Conditional Logic\n\nYou can show and hide fields based on what other fields are doing by utilizing conditional logic on a field by field basis. The `condition` property on a field's admin config accepts a function which takes three arguments:\n\n- `data` - the entire document's data that is currently being edited\n- `siblingData` - only the fields that are direct siblings to the field with the condition\n- `{ user }` - the final argument is an object containing the currently authenticated user\n\nThe `condition` function should return a boolean that will control if the field should be displayed or not.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```ts\n{\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'enableGreeting',\n      type: 'checkbox',\n      defaultValue: false,\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'greeting',\n      type: 'text',\n      admin: {\n        // highlight-start\n        condition: (data, siblingData, { user }) => {\n          if (data.enableGreeting) {\n            return true\n          } else {\n            return false\n          }\n        },\n        // highlight-end\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n",

When you build a [Custom Field Component](./fields), you will be responsible for sending and receiving the field's `value` to and from the form yourself.\n\nTo do so, import the `useField` hook as follows:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useField } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst CustomTextField: React.FC = () => {\n  const { value, setValue, path } = useField() // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>\n        {path}\n      </p>\n      <input\n        onChange={(e) => { setValue(e.target.value) }}\n        value={value}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `useField` hook accepts the following arguments:\n\n| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `path`            | If you do not provide a `path` or a `name`, this hook will look for one using the [`useFieldProps`](#usefieldprops) hook.                                                                                                                         |\n| `validate`        | A validation function executed client-side _before_ submitting the form to the server. Different than [Field-level Validation](../fields/overview#validation) which runs strictly on the server. |\n| `disableFormData` | If `true`, the field will not be included in the form data when the form is submitted.                                                                                                                                         |\n| `hasRows` | If `true`, the field will be treated as a field with rows. This is useful for fields like `array` and `blocks`.                                                                                                                                         |\n\nThe `useField` hook returns the following object:\n\n```ts\ntype FieldResult<T> = {\n  errorMessage?: string\n  errorPaths?: string[]\n  filterOptions?: FilterOptionsResult\n  formInitializing: boolean\n  formProcessing: boolean\n  formSubmitted: boolean\n  initialValue?: T\n  path: string\n  permissions: FieldPermissions\n  readOnly?: boolean\n  rows?: Row[]\n  schemaPath: string\n  setValue: (val: unknown, disableModifyingForm?: boolean) => voi\n  showError: boolean\n  valid?: boolean\n  value: T\n}\n```\n\n## useFieldProps\n\nAll [Custom Field Components](./fields#the-field-component) are rendered on the server, and as such, only have access to static props at render time. But, some fields can be dynamic, such as when nested in an [`array`](../fields/array) or [`blocks`](../fields/block) field. For example, items can be added, re-ordered, or deleted on-the-fly.\n\nFor this reason, dynamic props like `path` are managed in their own React context, which can be accessed using the `useFieldProps` hook:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useFieldProps } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst CustomTextField: React.FC = () => {\n  const { path } = useFieldProps() // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {path}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  The [`useField`](#usefield) hook calls the `useFieldProps` hook internally, so you don't need to use both in the same component unless explicitly needed.\n</Banner>\n\n## useFormFields\n\nThere are times when a custom field component needs to have access to data from other fields, and you have a few options to do so. The `useFormFields` hook is a powerful and highly performant way to retrieve a form's field state, as well as to retrieve the `dispatchFields` method, which can be helpful for setting other fields' form states from anywhere within a form.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>This hook is great for retrieving only certain fields from form state</strong> because it\n  ensures that it will only cause a rerender when the items that you ask for change.\n</Banner>\n\nThanks to the awesome package [`use-context-selector`](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector), you can retrieve a specific field's state easily. This is ideal because you can ensure you have an up-to-date field state, and your component will only re-render when _that field's state_ changes.\n\nYou can pass a Redux-like selector into the hook, which will ensure that you retrieve only the field that you want. The selector takes an argument with type of `[fields: Fields, dispatch: React.Dispatch<Action>]]`.\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport type { useFormFields } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // Get only the `amount` field state, and only cause a rerender when that field changes\n  const amount = useFormFields(([fields, dispatch]) => fields.amount)\n\n  // Do the same thing as above, but to the `feePercentage` field\n  const feePercentage = useFormFields(([fields, dispatch]) => fields.feePercentage)\n\n  if (typeof amount?.value !== 'undefined' && typeof feePercentage?.value !== 'undefined') {\n    return <span>The fee is ${(amount.value * feePercentage.value) / 100}</span>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## useAllFormFields\n\n**To retrieve more than one field**, you can use the `useAllFormFields` hook. Your component will re-render when _any_ field changes, so use this hook only if you absolutely need to. Unlike the `useFormFields` hook, this hook does not accept a \"selector\", and it always returns an array with type of `[fields: Fields, dispatch: React.Dispatch<Action>]]`.\n\nYou can do lots of powerful stuff by retrieving the full form state, like using built-in helper functions to reduce field state to values only, or to retrieve sibling data by path.\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useAllFormFields } from '@payloadcms/ui'\nimport { reduceFieldsToValues, getSiblingData } from 'payload/shared'\n\nconst ExampleComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // the `fields` const will be equal to all fields' state,\n  // and the `dispatchFields` method is usable to send field state up to the form\n  const [fields, dispatchFields] = useAllFormFields();\n\n  // Pass in fields, and indicate if you'd like to \"unflatten\" field data.\n  // The result below will reflect the data stored in the form at the given time\n  const formData = reduceFieldsToValues(fields, true);\n\n  // Pass in field state and a path,\n  // and you will be sent all sibling data of the path that you've specified\n  const siblingData = getSiblingData(fields, 'someFieldName');\n\n  return (\n    // return some JSX here if necessary\n  )\n};\n```\n\n#### Updating other fields' values\n\nIf you are building a Custom Component, then you should use `setValue` which is returned from the `useField` hook to programmatically set your field's value. But if you're looking to update _another_ field's value, you can use `dispatchFields` returned from `useFormFields`.\n\nYou can send the following actions to the `dispatchFields` function.\n\n| Action                 | Description                                                                |\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`ADD_ROW`**          | Adds a row of data (useful in array / block field data)                    |\n| **`DUPLICATE_ROW`**    | Duplicates a row of data (useful in array / block field data)              |\n| **`MODIFY_CONDITION`** | Updates a field's conditional logic result (true / false)                  |\n| **`MOVE_ROW`**         | Moves a row of data (useful in array / block field data)                   |\n| **`REMOVE`**           | Removes a field from form state                                            |\n| **`REMOVE_ROW`**       | Removes a row of data from form state (useful in array / block field data) |\n| **`REPLACE_STATE`**    | Completely replaces form state                                             |\n| **`UPDATE`**           | Update any property of a specific field's state                            |\n\nTo see types for each action supported within the `dispatchFields` hook, check out the Form types [here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/payload/src/admin/components/forms/Form/types.ts).\n\n## useForm\n\nThe `useForm` hook can be used to interact with the form itself, and sends back many methods that can be used to reactively fetch form state without causing rerenders within your components each time a field is changed. This is useful if you have action-based callbacks that your components fire, and need to interact with form state _based on a user action_.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  <br />\n  This hook is optimized to avoid causing rerenders when fields change, and as such, its `fields`\n  property will be out of date. You should only leverage this hook if you need to perform actions\n  against the form in response to your users' actions. Do not rely on its returned \"fields\" as being\n  up-to-date. They will be removed from this hook's response in an upcoming version.\n</Banner>\n\nThe `useForm` hook returns an object with the following properties:\n\n<TableWithDrawers\n  columns={[\n    'Action',\n    'Description',\n    'Example',\n  ]}\n  rows={[\n    [\n      {\n        value: <strong><code>fields</code></strong>,\n      },\n      {\n        value: \"Deprecated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`isCollapsed`**         | State of the collapsible. `true` if open, `false` if collapsed.                                               |\n| **`isVisible`**           | If nested, determine if the nearest collapsible is visible. `true` if no parent is closed, `false` otherwise. |\n| **`toggle`**              | Toggles the state of the nearest collapsible.                                                                 |\n| **`isWithinCollapsible`** | Determine when you are within another collapsible.                                                            |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\n\nimport { useCollapsible } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst CustomComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const { isCollapsed, toggle } = useCollapsible()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p className=\"field-type\">I am {isCollapsed ? 'closed' : 'open'}</p>\n      <button onClick={toggle} type=\"button\">\n        Toggle\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## useDocumentInfo\n\nThe `useDocumentInfo` hook provides lots of information about the document currently being edited, including the following:\n\n| Property                  | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **`collection`**          | If the doc is a collection, its Collection Config will be returned                                                 |\n| **`global`**              | If the doc is a global, its Global Config will be returned                                                         |\n| **`id`**                  | If the doc is a collection, its ID will be returned                                                                |\n| **`preferencesKey`**      | The `preferences` key to use when interacting with document-level user preferences                                 |\n| **`versions`**            | Versions of the current doc                                                                                        |\n| **`unpublishedVersions`** | Unpublished versions of the current doc                                                                            |\n| **`publishedDoc`**        | The currently published version of the doc being edited                                                            |\n| **`getVersions`**         | Method to trigger the retrieval of document versions                                                               |\n| **`docPermissions`**      | The current documents permissions. Collection document permissions fallback when no id is present (i.e. on create) |\n| **`getDocPermissions`**   | Method to trigger the retrieval of document level permissions                                                      |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useDocumentInfo } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst LinkFromCategoryToPosts: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const { id } = useDocumentInfo()\n  // highlight-end\n\n  // id will be undefined on the create form\n  if (!id) {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <a href={`/admin/collections/posts?where[or][0][and][0][category][in][0]=[${id}]`}>\n      View posts\n    </a>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## useLocale\n\nIn any Custom Component you can get the selected locale object with the `useLocale` hook. `useLocale`gives you the full locale object, consisting of a `label`, `rtl`(right-to-left) property, and then `code`. Here is a simple example:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useLocale } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst Greeting: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const locale = useLocale()\n  // highlight-end\n\n  const trans = {\n    en: 'Hello',\n    es: 'Hola',\n  }\n\n  return <span> {trans[locale.code]} </span>\n}\n```\n\n## useAuth\n\nUseful to retrieve info about the currently logged in user as well as methods for interacting with it. It sends back an object with the following properties:\n\n| Property                 | Description                                                                             |\n| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`user`**               | The currently logged in user                                                            |\n| **`logOut`**             | A method to log out the currently logged in user                                        |\n| **`refreshCookie`**      | A method to trigger the silent refreshing of a user's auth token                        |\n| **`setToken`**           | Set the token of the user, to be decoded and used to reset the user and token in memory |\n| **`token`**              | The logged in user's token (useful for creating preview links, etc.)                    |\n| **`refreshPermissions`** | Load new permissions (useful when content that effects permissions has been changed)    |\n| **`permissions`**        | The permissions of the current user                                                     |\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useAuth } from '@payloadcms/ui'\nimport type { User } from '../payload-types.ts'\n\nconst Greeting: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const { user } = useAuth<User>()\n  // highlight-end\n\n  return <span>Hi, {user.email}!</span>\n}\n```\n\n## useConfig\n\nUsed to easily retrieve the Payload [Client Config](./components#accessing-the-payload-config).\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useConfig } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const config = useConfig()\n  // highlight-end\n\n  return <span>{config.serverURL}</span>\n}\n```\n\n## useEditDepth\n\nSends back how many editing levels \"deep\" the current component is. Edit depth is relevant while adding new documents / editing documents in modal windows and other cases.\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useEditDepth } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const editDepth = useEditDepth()\n  // highlight-end\n\n  return <span>My component is {editDepth} levels deep</span>\n}\n```\n\n## usePreferences\n\nReturns methods to set and get user preferences. More info can be found [here](../admin/preferences).\n\n## useTheme\n\nReturns the currently selected theme (`light`, `dark` or `auto`), a set function to update it and a boolean `autoMode`, used to determine if the theme value should be set automatically based on the user's device preferences.\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useTheme } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const { autoMode, setTheme, theme } = useTheme()\n  // highlight-end\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <span>\n        The current theme is {theme} and autoMode is {autoMode}\n      </span>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => setTheme((prev) => (prev === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'))}\n      >\n        Toggle theme\n      </button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## useTableColumns\n\nReturns methods to manipulate table columns\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useTableColumns } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const { setActiveColumns } = useTableColumns()\n\n  const resetColumns = () => {\n    setActiveColumns(['id', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt'])\n  }\n  // highlight-end\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={resetColumns}>\n      Reset columns\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## useTableCell\n\nSimilar to [`useFieldProps`](#usefieldprops), all [Custom Cell Components](./fields#the-cell-component) are rendered on the server, and as such, only have access to static props at render time. But, some props need to be dynamic, such as the field value itself.\n\nFor this reason, dynamic props like `cellData` are managed in their own React context, which can be accessed using the `useTableCell` hook.\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useTableCell } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const { cellData } = useTableCell() // highlight-line\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {cellData}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## useDocumentEvents\n\nThe `useDocumentEvents` hook provides a way of subscribing to cross-document events, such as updates made to nested documents within a drawer. This hook will report document events that are outside the scope of the document currently being edited. This hook provides the following:\n\n| Property               | Description                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`mostRecentUpdate`** | An object containing the most recently updated document. It contains the `entitySlug`, `id` (if collection), and `updatedAt` properties |\n| **`reportUpdate`**     | A method used to report updates to documents. It accepts the same arguments as the `mostRecentUpdate` property.                         |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useDocumentEvents } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst ListenForUpdates: React.FC = () => {\n  const { mostRecentUpdate } = useDocumentEvents()\n\n  return <span>{JSON.stringify(mostRecentUpdate)}</span>\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Right now the `useDocumentEvents` hook only tracks recently updated documents, but in the future\n  it will track more document-related events as needed, such as document creation, deletion, etc.\n</Banner>\n",

        "content": "\nAs your users interact with the [Admin Panel](./overview), you might want to store their preferences in a persistent manner, so that when they revisit the Admin Panel in a different session or from a different device, they can pick right back up where they left off.\n\nOut of the box, Payload handles the persistence of your users' preferences in a handful of ways, including:\n\n1. Columns in the Collection List View: their active state and order\n1. The user's last active [Locale](../configuration/localization)\n1. The \"collapsed\" state of `blocks`, `array`, and `collapsible` fields\n1. The last-known state of the `Nav` component, etc.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  All preferences are stored on an individual user basis. Payload automatically recognizes the user\n  that is reading or setting a preference via all provided authentication methods.\n</Banner>\n\n## Use cases\n\nThis API is used significantly for internal operations of the Admin Panel, as mentioned above. But, if you're building your own React components for use in the Admin Panel, you can allow users to set their own preferences in correspondence to their usage of your components. For example:\n\n- If you have built a \"color picker\", you could \"remember\" the last used colors that the user has set for easy access next time\n- If you've built a custom `Nav` component, and you've built in an \"accordion-style\" UI, you might want to store the `collapsed` state of each Nav collapsible item. This way, if an editor returns to the panel, their `Nav` state is persisted automatically\n- You might want to store `recentlyAccessed` documents to give admin editors an easy shortcut back to their recently accessed documents on the `Dashboard` or similar\n- Many other use cases exist. Invent your own! Give your editors an intelligent and persistent editing experience.\n\n## Database\n\nPayload automatically creates an internally used `payload-preferences` Collection that stores user preferences. Each document in the `payload-preferences` Collection contains the following shape:\n\n| Key               | Value                                                             |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`              | A unique ID for each preference stored.                           |\n| `key`             | A unique `key` that corresponds to the preference.                |\n| `user.value`      | The ID of the `user` that is storing its preference.              |\n| `user.relationTo` | The `slug` of the Collection that the `user` is logged in as.     |\n| `value`           | The value of the preference. Can be any data shape that you need. |\n| `createdAt`       | A timestamp of when the preference was created.                   |\n| `updatedAt`       | A timestamp set to the last time the preference was updated.      |\n\n## APIs\n\nPreferences are available to both [GraphQL](../graphql/overview#preferences) and [REST](../rest-api/overview#) APIs.\n\n## Adding or reading Preferences in your own components\n\nThe Payload Admin Panel offers a `usePreferences` hook. The hook is only meant for use within the Admin Panel itself. It provides you with two methods:\n\n#### `getPreference`\n\nThis async method provides an easy way to retrieve a user's preferences by `key`. It will return a promise containing the resulting preference value.\n\n**Arguments**\n\n- `key`: the `key` of your preference to retrieve.\n\n#### `setPreference`\n\nAlso async, this method provides you with an easy way to set a user preference. It returns `void`.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n- `key`: the `key` of your preference to set.\n- `value`: the `value` of your preference that you're looking to set.\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example for how you can utilize `usePreferences` within your custom Admin Panel components. Note - this example is not fully useful and is more just a reference for how to utilize the Preferences API. In this case, we are demonstrating how to set and retrieve a user's last used colors history within a `ColorPicker` or similar type component.\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport React, { Fragment, useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { usePreferences } from '@payloadcms/ui'\n\nconst lastUsedColorsPreferenceKey = 'last-used-colors';\n\nconst CustomComponent = (props) => {\n  const { getPreference, setPreference } = usePreferences();\n\n  // Store the last used colors in local state\n  const [lastUsedColors, setLastUsedColors] = useState([]);\n\n  // Callback to add a color to the last used colors\n  const updateLastUsedColors = useCallback((color) => {\n    // First, check if color already exists in last used colors.\n    // If it already exists, there is no need to update preferences\n    const colorAlreadyExists = lastUsedColors.indexOf(color) > -1;\n\n    if (!colorAlreadyExists) {\n      const newLastUsedColors = [\n        ...lastUsedColors,\n        color,\n      ];\n\n      setLastUsedColors(newLastUsedColors);\n      setPreference(lastUsedColorsPreferenceKey, newLastUsedColors);\n    }\n  }, [lastUsedColors, setPreference]);\n\n  // Retrieve preferences on component mount\n  // This will only be run one time, because the `getPreference` method never changes\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const asyncGetPreference = async () => {\n      const lastUsedColorsFromPreferences = await getPreference(lastUsedColorsPreferenceKey);\n      setLastUsedColors(lastUsedColorsFromPreferences);\n    };\n\n    asyncGetPreference();\n  }, [getPreference]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('red')}\n      >\n        Use red\n      </button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('blue')}\n      >\n        Use blue\n      </button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('purple')}\n      >\n        Use purple\n      </button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('yellow')}\n      >\n        Use yellow\n      </button>\n      {lastUsedColors && (\n        <Fragment>\n          <h5>Last used colors:</h5>\n          <ul>\n            {lastUsedColors?.map((color) => (\n              <li key={color}>\n                {color}\n              </li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </Fragment>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CustomComponent;\n```\n",

        "content": "\nCustomizing the Payload [Admin Panel](./overview) through CSS alone is one of the easiest and most powerful ways to customize the look and feel of the dashboard. To allow for this level of customization, Payload:\n\n1. Exposes a [root-level stylesheet](#global-css) for you to easily to inject custom selectors\n1. Provides a [CSS library](#css-library) that can be easily overridden or extended\n1. Uses [BEM naming conventions](http://getbem.com) so that class names are globally accessible\n\nTo customize the CSS within the Admin UI, determine scope and change you'd like to make, and then add your own CSS or SCSS to the configuration as needed.\n\n## Global CSS\n\nGlobal CSS refers to the CSS that is applied to the entire [Admin Panel](./overview). This is where you can have a significant impact to the look and feel of the Admin UI through just a few lines of code.\n\nYou can add your own global CSS through the root `custom.scss` file of your app. This file is loaded into the root of the Admin Panel and can be used to inject custom selectors or styles however needed.\n\nHere is an example of how you might target the Dashboard View and change the background color:\n\n```scss\n.dashboard {\n  background-color: red; // highlight-line\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  If you are building [Custom Components](./overview), it is best to import your own stylesheets directly into your components, rather than using the global stylesheet. You can continue to use the [CSS library](#css-library) as needed.\n</Banner>\n\n## Re-using Payload SCSS variables and utilities\n\nYou can re-use Payload's SCSS variables and utilities in your own stylesheets by importing it from the UI package.\n\n```scss\n@import '~@payloadcms/ui/scss';\n```\n\n## CSS Library\n\nTo make it as easy as possible for you to override default styles, Payload uses [BEM naming conventions](http://getbem.com/) for all CSS within the Admin UI. If you provide your own CSS, you can override any built-in styles easily, including targeting nested components and their various component states.\n\nYou can also override Payload's built-in [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). These variables are widely consumed by the Admin Panel, so modifying them has a significant impact on the look and feel of the Admin UI.\n\nThe following variables are defined and can be overridden:\n\n- [Breakpoints](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/beta/packages/ui/src/scss/queries.scss)\n- [Colors](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/beta/packages/ui/src/scss/colors.scss)\n  - Base color shades (white to black by default)\n  - Success / warning / error color shades\n  - Theme-specific colors (background, input background, text color, etc.)\n  - Elevation colors (used to determine how \"bright\" something should be when compared to the background)\n- [Sizing](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/beta/packages/ui/src/scss/app.scss)\n  - Horizontal gutter\n  - Transition speeds\n  - Font sizes\n  - Etc.\n\nFor an up-to-date, comprehensive list of all available variables, please refer to the [Source Code](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/ui/src/scss).\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  If you're overriding colors or theme elevations, make sure to consider how [your changes will affect dark mode](#dark-mode).\n</Banner>\n\n#### Dark Mode\n\nColors are designed to automatically adapt to theme of the [Admin Panel](./overview). By default, Payload automatically overrides all `--theme-elevation` colors and inverts all success / warning / error shades to suit dark mode. We also update some base theme variables like `--theme-bg`, `--theme-text`, etc.\n",

Slate has a lot of good stuff, but Lexical has lots more.\n\nNo matter which editor you use, you have to install it at the top-level on the `config.editor` property, which will then cascade throughout all of your rich text fields and be used accordingly.

It's battle-tested and will continue to be supported into the future.\n\nIf you are migrating a Payload project from 1.x or earlier, you can continue to use the Slate editor as long as you'd like.\n\nTo use the Slate editor, first you need to install it:\n\n```\nnpm install --save @payloadcms/richtext-slate\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can pass it to your top-level Payload config:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // your collections here\n  ],\n  // Pass the Slate editor to the root config\n  editor: slateEditor({}),\n})\n```\n\nAnd here's an example for how to install the Slate editor on a field-by-field basis, while customizing its options:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'content',\n      type: 'richText',\n      // Pass the Slate editor here and configure it accordingly\n      editor: slateEditor({\n        admin: {\n          elements: [\n            // customize elements allowed in Slate editor here\n          ],\n          leaves: [\n            // customize leaves allowed in Slate editor here\n          ],\n        },\n      }),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Admin Options\n\n**`elements`**\n\nThe `elements` property is used to specify which built-in or custom [SlateJS elements](https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/02-nodes#element) should be made available to the field within the admin panel.\n\nThe default `elements` available in Payload are:\n\n- `h1`\n- `h2`\n- `h3`\n- `h4`\n- `h5`\n- `h6`\n- `blockquote`\n- `link`\n- `ol`\n- `ul`\n- `textAlign`\n- `indent`\n- [`relationship`](#relationship-element)\n- [`upload`](#upload-element)\n- [`textAlign`](#text-align)\n\n**`leaves`**\n\nThe `leaves` property specifies built-in or custom [SlateJS leaves](https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/08-rendering#leaves) to be enabled within the Admin panel.\n\nThe default `leaves` available in Payload are:\n\n- `bold`\n- `code`\n- `italic`\n- `strikethrough`\n- `underline`\n\n**`link.fields`**\n\nThis allows [fields](../fields/overview) to be saved as extra fields on a link inside the Rich Text Editor. When this is present, the fields will render inside a modal that can be opened by clicking the \"edit\" button on the link element.\n\n`link.fields` may either be an array of fields (in which case all fields defined in it will be appended below the default fields) or a function that accepts the default fields as only argument and returns an array defining the entirety of fields to be used (thus providing a mechanism of overriding the default fields).\n\n![RichText link fields](https://payloadcms.com/images/docs/fields/richText/rte-link-fields-modal.jpg)\n_RichText link with custom fields_\n\n**`upload.collections[collection-name].fields`**\n\nThis allows [fields](../fields/overview) to be saved as meta data on an upload field inside the Rich Text Editor. When this is present, the fields will render inside a modal that can be opened by clicking the \"edit\" button on the upload element.\n\n![RichText upload element](https://payloadcms.com/images/docs/fields/richText/rte-upload-element.jpg)\n_RichText field using the upload element_\n\n![RichText upload element modal](https://payloadcms.com/images/docs/fields/richText/rte-upload-fields-modal.jpg)\n_RichText upload element modal displaying fields from the config_\n\n### Relationship element\n\nThe built-in `relationship` element is a powerful way to reference other Documents directly within your Rich Text editor.\n\n### Upload element\n\nSimilar to the `relationship` element, the `upload` element is a user-friendly way to reference [Upload-enabled collections](../upload/overview) with a UI specifically designed for media / image-based uploads.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Collections are automatically allowed to be selected within the Rich Text relationship and upload\n  elements by default. If you want to disable a collection from being able to be referenced in Rich\n  Text fields, set the collection admin options of <strong>enableRichTextLink</strong> and{' '}\n  <strong>enableRichTextRelationship</strong> to false.\n</Banner>\n\nRelationship and Upload elements are populated dynamically into your Rich Text field' content. Within the REST and Local APIs, any present RichText `relationship` or `upload` elements will respect the `depth` option that you pass, and will be populated accordingly. In GraphQL, each `richText` field accepts an argument of `depth` for you to utilize.\n\n### TextAlign element\n\nText Alignment is not included by default and can be added to a Rich Text Editor by adding `textAlign` to the list of elements. TextAlign will alter the existing element to include a new `textAlign` field in the resulting JSON. This field can be used in combination with other elements and leaves to position content to the left, center or right.\n\n### Specifying which elements and leaves to allow\n\nTo specify which default elements or leaves should be allowed to be used for this field, define arrays that contain string names for each element or leaf you wish to enable. To specify a custom element or leaf, pass an object with all corresponding properties as outlined below. View the [example](#example) to reference how this all works.\n\n### Building custom elements and leaves\n\nYou can design and build your own Slate elements and leaves to extend the editor with your own functionality. To do so, first start by reading the [SlateJS documentation](https://docs.slatejs.org/) and looking at the [Slate examples](https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext) to familiarize yourself with the SlateJS editor as a whole.\n\nOnce you're up to speed with the general concepts involved, you can pass in your own elements and leaves to your field's admin config.\n\n**Both custom elements and leaves are defined via the following config:**\n\n| Property        | Description                                                |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`name`** \\*   | The default name to be used as a `type` for this element.  |\n| **`Button`** \\* | A React component to be rendered in the Rich Text toolbar. |\n| **`plugins`**   | An array of plugins to provide to the Rich Text editor.    |\n| **`type`**      | A type that overrides the default type used by `name`      |\n\nCustom `Element`s also require the `Element` property set to a React component to be rendered as the `Element` within the rich text editor itself.\n\nCustom `Leaf` objects follow a similar pattern but require you to define the `Leaf` property instead.\n\nSpecifying custom `Type`s let you extend your custom elements by adding additional fields to your JSON object.\n\n### Example\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'content', // required\n      type: 'richText', // required\n      defaultValue: [\n        {\n          children: [{ text: 'Here is some default content for this field' }],\n        },\n      ],\n      required: true,\n      editor: slateEditor({\n        admin: {\n          elements: [\n            'h2',\n            'h3',\n            'h4',\n            'link',\n            'blockquote',\n            {\n              name: 'cta',\n              Button: CustomCallToActionButton,\n              Element: CustomCallToActionElement,\n              plugins: [\n                // any plugins that are required by this element go here\n              ],\n            },\n          ],\n          leaves: [\n            'bold',\n            'italic',\n            {\n              name: 'highlight',\n              Button: CustomHighlightButton,\n              Leaf: CustomHighlightLeaf,\n              plugins: [\n                // any plugins that are required by this leaf go here\n              ],\n            },\n          ],\n          link: {\n            // Inject your own fields into the Link element\n            fields: [\n              {\n                name: 'rel',\n                label: 'Rel Attribute',\n                type: 'select',\n                hasMany: true,\n                options: ['noopener', 'noreferrer', 'nofollow'],\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          upload: {\n            collections: {\n              media: {\n                fields: [\n                  // any fields that you would like to save\n                  // on an upload element in the `media` collection\n                ],\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      }),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Generating HTML\n\nAs the Rich Text field saves its content in a JSON format, you'll need to render it as HTML yourself. Here is an example for how to generate JSX / HTML from Rich Text content:\n\n```ts\nimport React, { Fragment } from \"react\";\nimport escapeHTML from \"escape-html\";\nimport { Text } from \"slate\";\n\nconst serialize = (children) =>\n  children.map((node, i) => {\n    if (Text.isText(node)) {\n      let text = (\n        <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: escapeHTML(node.text) }} />\n      );\n\n      if (node.bold) {\n        text = <strong key={i}>{text}</strong>;\n      }\n\n      if (node.code) {\n        text = <code key={i}>{text}</code>;\n      }\n\n      if (node.italic) {\n        text = <em key={i}>{text}</em>;\n      }\n\n      // Handle other leaf types here...\n\n      return <Fragment key={i}>{text}</Fragment>;\n    }\n\n    if (!node) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    switch (node.type) {\n      case \"h1\":\n        return <h1 key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</h1>;\n      // Iterate through all headings here...\n      case \"h6\":\n        return <h6 key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</h6>;\n      case \"blockquote\":\n        return <blockquote key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</blockquote>;\n      case \"ul\":\n        return <ul key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</ul>;\n      case \"ol\":\n        return <ol key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</ol>;\n      case \"li\":\n        return <li key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</li>;\n      case \"link\":\n        return (\n          <a href={escapeHTML(node.url)} key={i}>\n            {serialize(node.children)}\n          </a>\n        );\n\n      default:\n        return <p key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</p>;\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The above example is for how to render to JSX, although for plain HTML the pattern is similar.\n  Just remove the JSX and return HTML strings instead!\n</Banner>\n\n### Built-in SlateJS Plugins\n\nPayload comes with a few built-in SlateJS plugins which can be extended to make developing your own elements and leaves a bit easier.\n\n#### `shouldBreakOutOnEnter`\n\nPayload's built-in heading elements all allow a \"hard return\" to \"break out\" of the currently active element. For example, if you hit `enter` while typing an `h1`, the `h1` will be \"broken out of\" and you'll be able to continue writing as the default paragraph element.\n\nIf you want to utilize this functionality within your own custom elements, you can do so by adding a custom plugin to your `element` like the following \"large body\" element example:\n\n`customLargeBodyElement.js`:\n\n```ts\nimport Button from './Button'\nimport Element from './Element'\nimport withLargeBody from './plugin'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'large-body',\n  Button,\n  Element,\n  plugins: [\n    (incomingEditor) => {\n      const editor = incomingEditor\n      const { shouldBreakOutOnEnter } = editor\n\n      editor.shouldBreakOutOnEnter = (element) =>\n        element.type === 'large-body' ? true : shouldBreakOutOnEnter(element)\n\n      return editor\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nAbove, you can see that we are creating a custom SlateJS element with a name of `large-body`. This might render a slightly larger body copy on the frontend of your app(s). We pass it a name, button, and element&mdash;but additionally, we pass it a `plugins` array containing a single SlateJS plugin.\n\nThe plugin itself extends Payload's built-in `shouldBreakOutOnEnter` Slate function to add its own element name to the list of elements that should \"break out\" when the `enter` key is pressed.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nIf you are building your own custom Rich Text elements or leaves, you may benefit from importing the following types:\n\n```ts\nimport type { RichTextCustomElement, RichTextCustomLeaf } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n```\n",

        "content": "\nOne of Payload's goals is to build the best rich text editor experience that we possibly can. We want to combine the beauty and polish of the Medium editing experience with the strength and features of the Notion editor - all in one place.\n\nClassically, we've used SlateJS to work toward this goal, but building custom elements into Slate has proven to be more difficult than we'd like, and we've been keeping our options open.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Payload's Lexical rich text editor is currently in beta. It's stable enough to use as you build on\n  Payload, so if you're up for helping us fine-tune it, you should use it. But if you're looking for\n  stability, use Slate instead.\n</Banner>\n\nLexical is extremely impressive and trivializes a lot of the hard parts of building new elements into a rich text editor. It has a few distinct advantages over Slate, including the following:\n\n1. A \"/\" menu, which allows editors to easily add new elements while never leaving their keyboard\n1. A \"hover\" toolbar that pops up if you select text\n1. It supports Payload blocks natively, directly within your rich text editor\n1. Custom elements, called \"features\", are much easier to build in Lexical vs. Slate\n\nTo use the Lexical editor, first you need to install it:\n\n```\nnpm install @payloadcms/richtext-lexical\n```\n\nOnce you have it installed, you can pass it to your top-level Payload config as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // your collections here\n  ],\n  // Pass the Lexical editor to the root config\n  editor: lexicalEditor({}),\n})\n```\n\nYou can also override Lexical settings on a field-by-field basis as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'content',\n      type: 'richText',\n      // Pass the Lexical editor here and override base settings as necessary\n      editor: lexicalEditor({}),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Extending the lexical editor with Features\n\nLexical has been designed with extensibility in mind. Whether you're aiming to introduce new functionalities or tweak the existing ones, Lexical makes it seamless for you to bring those changes to life.\n\n### Features: The Building Blocks\n\nAt the heart of Lexical's customization potential are \"features\". While Lexical ships with a set of default features we believe are essential for most use cases, the true power lies in your ability to redefine, expand, or prune these as needed.\n\nIf you remove all the default features, you're left with a blank editor. You can then add in only the features you need, or you can build your own custom features from scratch.\n\n### Integrating New Features\n\nTo weave in your custom features, utilize the `features` prop when initializing the Lexical Editor. Here's a basic example of how this is done:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  BlocksFeature,\n  LinkFeature,\n  UploadFeature,\n  lexicalEditor,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\nimport { Banner } from '../blocks/Banner'\nimport { CallToAction } from '../blocks/CallToAction'\n\n{\n  editor: lexicalEditor({\n    features: ({ defaultFeatures, rootFeatures }) => [\n      ...defaultFeatures,\n      LinkFeature({\n        // Example showing how to customize the built-in fields\n        // of the Link feature\n        fields: ({ defaultFields }) => [\n          ...defaultFields,\n          {\n            name: 'rel',\n            label: 'Rel Attribute',\n            type: 'select',\n            hasMany: true,\n            options: ['noopener', 'noreferrer', 'nofollow'],\n            admin: {\n              description:\n                'The rel attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource and the current document. This is a custom link field.',\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      }),\n      UploadFeature({\n        collections: {\n          uploads: {\n            // Example showing how to customize the built-in fields\n            // of the Upload feature\n            fields: [\n              {\n                name: 'caption',\n                type: 'richText',\n                editor: lexicalEditor(),\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n        },\n      }),\n      // This is incredibly powerful. You can re-use your Payload blocks\n      // directly in the Lexical editor as follows:\n      BlocksFeature({\n        blocks: [Banner, CallToAction],\n      }),\n    ],\n  })\n}\n```\n\n`features` can be both an array of features, or a function returning an array of features. The function provides the following props:\n\n\n| Prop                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`defaultFeatures`** | This opinionated array contains all \"recommended\" default features. You can see which features are included in the default features in the table below.                                                                                                |\n| **`rootFeatures`**    | This array contains all features that are enabled in the root richText editor (the one defined in the payload.config.ts). If this field is the root richText editor, or if the root richText editor is not a lexical editor, this array will be empty. |\n\n\n## Features overview\n\nHere's an overview of all the included features:\n\n| Feature Name                    | Included by default | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`BoldTextFeature`**           | Yes                 | Handles the bold text format                                                                                                                                                           |\n| **`ItalicTextFeature`**         | Yes                 | Handles the italic text format                                                                                                                                                         |\n| **`UnderlineTextFeature`**      | Yes                 | Handles the underline text format                                                                                                                                                      |\n| **`StrikethroughTextFeature`**  | Yes                 | Handles the strikethrough text format                                                                                                                                                  |\n| **`SubscriptTextFeature`**      | Yes                 | Handles the subscript text format                                                                                                                                                      |\n| **`SuperscriptTextFeature`**    | Yes                 | Handles the superscript text format                                                                                                                                                    |\n| **`InlineCodeTextFeature`**     | Yes                 | Handles the inline-code text format                                                                                                                                                    |\n| **`ParagraphFeature`**          | Yes                 | Handles paragraphs. Since they are already a key feature of lexical itself, this Feature mainly handles the Slash and Add-Block menu entries for paragraphs                            |\n| **`HeadingFeature`**            | Yes                 | Adds Heading Nodes (by default, H1 - H6, but that can be customized)                                                                                                                   |\n| **`AlignFeature`**              | Yes                 | Allows you to align text left, centered and right                                                                                                                                      |\n| **`IndentFeature`**             | Yes                 | Allows you to indent text with the tab key                                                                                                                                             |\n| **`UnorderedListFeature`**      | Yes                 | Adds unordered lists (ul)                                                                                                                                                              |\n| **`OrderedListFeature`**        | Yes                 | Adds ordered lists (ol)                                                                                                                                                                |\n| **`CheckListFeature`**          | Yes                 | Adds checklists                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **`LinkFeature`**               | Yes                 | Allows you to create internal and external links                                                                                                                                       |\n| **`RelationshipFeature`**       | Yes                 | Allows you to create block-level (not inline) relationships to other documents                                                                                                         |\n| **`BlockQuoteFeature`**         | Yes                 | Allows you to create block-level quotes                                                                                                                                                |\n| **`UploadFeature`**             | Yes                 | Allows you to create block-level upload nodes - this supports all kinds of uploads, not just images                                                                                    |\n| **`HorizontalRuleFeature`**     | Yes                 | Horizontal rules / separators. Basically displays an `<hr>` element                                                                                                                    |\n| **`InlineToolbarFeature`**      | Yes                 | The inline toolbar is the floating toolbar which appears when you select text. This toolbar only contains actions relevant for selected text                                           |\n| **`FixedToolbarFeature`**       | No                  | This classic toolbar is pinned to the top and always visible. Both inline and fixed toolbars can be enabled at the same time.                                                          |\n| **`BlocksFeature`**             | No                  | Allows you to use Payload's [Blocks Field](../fields/blocks) directly inside your editor. In the feature props, you can specify the allowed blocks - just like in the Blocks field. |\n| **`TreeViewFeature`**           | No                  | Adds a debug box under the editor, which allows you to see the current editor state live, the dom, as well as time travel. Very useful for debugging                                   |\n| **`EXPERIMENTAL_TableFeature`** | No                  | Adds support for tables. This feature may be removed or receive breaking changes in the future - even within a stable lexical release, without needing a major release.                |\n\nNotice how even the toolbars are features? That's how extensible our lexical editor is - you could theoretically create your own toolbar if you wanted to!\n\n## Creating your own, custom Feature\n\nYou can find more information about creating your own feature in our [building custom feature docs](lexical/building-custom-features).\n\n## TypeScript\n\nEvery single piece of saved data is 100% fully-typed within lexical. It provides a type for every single node, which can be imported from `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` - each type is prefixed with `Serialized`, e.g. `SerializedUploadNode`.\n\nIn order to fully type the entire editor JSON, you can use our `TypedEditorState` helper type, which accepts a union of all possible node types as a generic. The reason we do not provide a type which already contains all possible node types is because the possible node types depend on which features you have enabled in your editor. Here is an example:\n\n```ts\nimport type {\n  SerializedAutoLinkNode,\n  SerializedBlockNode,\n  SerializedHorizontalRuleNode,\n  SerializedLinkNode,\n  SerializedListItemNode,\n  SerializedListNode,\n  SerializedParagraphNode,\n  SerializedQuoteNode,\n  SerializedRelationshipNode,\n  SerializedTextNode,\n  SerializedUploadNode,\n  TypedEditorState,\n  SerializedHeadingNode,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst editorState: TypedEditorState<\n  | SerializedAutoLinkNode\n  | SerializedBlockNode\n  | SerializedHorizontalRuleNode\n  | SerializedLinkNode\n  | SerializedListItemNode\n  | SerializedListNode\n  | SerializedParagraphNode\n  | SerializedQuoteNode\n  | SerializedRelationshipNode\n  | SerializedTextNode\n  | SerializedUploadNode\n  | SerializedHeadingNode\n> = {\n  root: {\n    type: 'root',\n    direction: 'ltr',\n    format: '',\n    indent: 0,\n    version: 1,\n    children: [\n      {\n        children: [\n          {\n            detail: 0,\n            format: 0,\n            mode: 'normal',\n            style: '',\n            text: 'Some text. Every property here is fully-typed',\n            type: 'text',\n            version: 1,\n          },\n        ],\n        direction: 'ltr',\n        format: '',\n        indent: 0,\n        type: 'paragraph',\n        textFormat: 0,\n        version: 1,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `DefaultTypedEditorState` type, which includes all types for all nodes included in the `defaultFeatures`:\n\n```ts\nimport type {\n  DefaultTypedEditorState\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst editorState: DefaultTypedEditorState = {\n  root: {\n    type: 'root',\n    direction: 'ltr',\n    format: '',\n    indent: 0,\n    version: 1,\n    children: [\n      {\n        children: [\n          {\n            detail: 0,\n            format: 0,\n            mode: 'normal',\n            style: '',\n            text: 'Some text. Every property here is fully-typed',\n            type: 'text',\n            version: 1,\n          },\n        ],\n        direction: 'ltr',\n        format: '',\n        indent: 0,\n        type: 'paragraph',\n        textFormat: 0,\n        version: 1,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nJust like `TypedEditorState`, the `DefaultTypedEditorState` also accepts an optional node type union as a generic. Here, this would **add** the specified node types to the default ones. Example: `DefaultTypedEditorState<SerializedBlockNode | YourCustomSerializedNode>`.\n\nThis is a type-safe representation of the editor state. Looking at the auto-suggestions of `type` it will show you all the possible node types you can use.\n\nMake sure to only use types exported from `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`, not from the lexical core packages. We only have control over types we export and can guarantee that those are correct, even though lexical core may export types with identical names.\n\n### Automatic type generation\n\nLexical does not generate the accurate type definitions for your richText fields for you yet - this will be improved in the future. Currently, it only outputs the rough shape of the editor JSON which you can enhance using type assertions.\n",

        "content": "\n## Lexical => HTML\n\nLexical saves data in JSON, but can also generate its HTML representation via two main methods:\n\n1. **Outputting HTML from the Collection:** Create a new field in your collection to convert saved JSON content to HTML. Payload generates and outputs the HTML for use in your frontend.\n2. **Generating HTML on any server** Convert JSON to HTML on-demand on the server.\n\nThe editor comes with built-in HTML serializers, simplifying the process of converting JSON to HTML.\n\n### Outputting HTML from the Collection\n\nTo add HTML generation directly within the collection, follow the example below:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nimport { HTMLConverterFeature, lexicalEditor, lexicalHTML } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',\n      type: 'richText',\n      editor: lexicalEditor({\n        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [\n          ...defaultFeatures,\n          // The HTMLConverter Feature is the feature which manages the HTML serializers.\n          // If you do not pass any arguments to it, it will use the default serializers.\n          HTMLConverterFeature({}),\n        ],\n      }),\n    },\n    lexicalHTML('nameOfYourRichTextField', { name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField_html' }),\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nThe `lexicalHTML()` function creates a new field that automatically converts the referenced lexical richText field into HTML through an afterRead hook.\n\n### Generating HTML anywhere on the server\n\nIf you wish to convert JSON to HTML ad-hoc, use the `convertLexicalToHTML` function:\n\n```ts\nimport { consolidateHTMLConverters, convertLexicalToHTML } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\n\nawait convertLexicalToHTML({\n  converters: consolidateHTMLConverters({ editorConfig }),\n  data: editorData,\n  payload, // if you have payload but no req available, pass it in here to enable server-only functionality (e.g. proper conversion of upload nodes)\n  req, // if you have req available, pass it in here to enable server-only functionality (e.g. proper conversion of upload nodes). No need to pass in payload if req is passed in.\n})\n```\nThis method employs `convertLexicalToHTML` from `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`, which converts the serialized editor state into HTML.\n\nBecause every `Feature` is able to provide html converters, and because the `htmlFeature` can modify those or provide their own, we need to consolidate them with the default html Converters using the `consolidateHTMLConverters` function.\n\n#### Example: Generating HTML within an afterRead hook\n\n```ts\nimport type { FieldHook } from 'payload'\n\nimport {\n  HTMLConverterFeature,\n  consolidateHTMLConverters,\n  convertLexicalToHTML,\n  defaultEditorConfig,\n  defaultEditorFeatures,\n  sanitizeServerEditorConfig,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst hook: FieldHook = async ({ req, siblingData }) => {\n  const editorConfig = defaultEditorConfig\n\n  editorConfig.features = [...defaultEditorFeatures, HTMLConverterFeature({})]\n\n  const sanitizedEditorConfig = await sanitizeServerEditorConfig(editorConfig, req.payload.config)\n\n  const html = await convertLexicalToHTML({\n    converters: consolidateHTMLConverters({ editorConfig: sanitizedEditorConfig }),\n    data: siblingData.lexicalSimple,\n    req,\n  })\n  return html\n}\n```\n\n### CSS\n\nPayload's lexical HTML converter does not generate CSS for you, but it does add classes to the generated HTML. You can use these classes to style the HTML in your frontend.\n\nHere is some \"base\" CSS you can use to ensure that nested lists render correctly:\n\n```css\n/* Base CSS for Lexical HTML */\n.nestedListItem, .list-check {\n  list-style-type: none;\n}\n```\n\n### Creating your own HTML Converter\n\nHTML Converters are typed as `HTMLConverter`, which contains the node type it should handle, and a function that accepts the serialized node from the lexical editor, and outputs the HTML string. Here's the HTML Converter of the Upload node as an example:\n\n```ts\nimport type { HTMLConverter } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst UploadHTMLConverter: HTMLConverter<SerializedUploadNode> = {\n  converter: async ({ node, req }) => {\n    const uploadDocument: {\n      value?: any\n      } = {}\n    if(req) {\n      await populate({\n        id,\n        collectionSlug: node.relationTo,\n        currentDepth: 0,\n        data: uploadDocument,\n        depth: 1,\n        draft: false,\n        key: 'value',\n        overrideAccess: false,\n        req,\n        showHiddenFields: false,\n      })\n    }\n\n    const url = (req?.payload?.config?.serverURL || '') + uploadDocument?.value?.url\n\n    if (!(uploadDocument?.value?.mimeType as string)?.startsWith('image')) {\n      // Only images can be serialized as HTML\n      return ``\n    }\n\n    return `<img src=\"${url}\" alt=\"${uploadDocument?.value?.filename}\" width=\"${uploadDocument?.value?.width}\"  height=\"${uploadDocument?.value?.height}\"/>`\n  },\n  nodeTypes: [UploadNode.getType()], // This is the type of the lexical node that this converter can handle. Instead of hardcoding 'upload' we can get the node type directly from the UploadNode, since it's static.\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we have access to all the information saved in the node (for the Upload node, this is `value`and `relationTo`) and we can use that to generate the HTML.\n\nThe `convertLexicalToHTML` is part of `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` automatically handles traversing the editor state and calling the correct converter for each node.\n\n### Embedding the HTML Converter in your Feature\n\nYou can embed your HTML Converter directly within your custom `ServerFeature`, allowing it to be handled automatically by the `consolidateHTMLConverters` function. Here is an example:\n\n```ts\nimport { createNode } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\nimport type { FeatureProviderProviderServer } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport const UploadFeature: FeatureProviderProviderServer<\n  UploadFeatureProps,\n  UploadFeaturePropsClient\n> = (props) => {\n  /*...*/\n  return {\n    feature: () => {\n      return {\n        nodes: [\n          createNode({\n            converters: {\n              html: yourHTMLConverter, // <= This is where you define your HTML Converter\n            },\n            node: UploadNode,\n            //...\n          }),\n        ],\n        ClientComponent: UploadFeatureClientComponent,\n        clientFeatureProps: clientProps,\n        serverFeatureProps: props,\n        /*...*/\n      }\n    },\n    key: 'upload',\n    serverFeatureProps: props,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Headless Editor\n\nLexical provides a seamless way to perform conversions between various other formats:\n\n- HTML to Lexical (or, importing HTML into the lexical editor)\n- Markdown to Lexical (or, importing Markdown into the lexical editor)\n- Lexical to Markdown\n\nA headless editor can perform such conversions outside of the main editor instance. Follow this method to initiate a headless editor:\n\n```ts\nimport { createHeadlessEditor } from '@lexical/headless' // <= make sure this package is installed\nimport { getEnabledNodes, sanitizeServerEditorConfig } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst yourEditorConfig // <= your editor config here\nconst payloadConfig // <= your payload config here\n\nconst headlessEditor = createHeadlessEditor({\n  nodes: getEnabledNodes({\n    editorConfig: sanitizeServerEditorConfig(yourEditorConfig, payloadConfig),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n### Getting the editor config\n\nAs you can see, you need to provide an editor config in order to create a headless editor. This is because the editor config is used to determine which nodes & features are enabled, and which converters are used.\n\nTo get the editor config, simply import the default editor config and adjust it - just like you did inside of the `editor: lexicalEditor({})` property:\n\n```ts\nimport { defaultEditorConfig, defaultEditorFeatures } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical' // <= make sure this package is installed\n\nconst yourEditorConfig = defaultEditorConfig\n\n// If you made changes to the features of the field's editor config, you should also make those changes here:\nyourEditorConfig.features = [\n  ...defaultEditorFeatures,\n  // Add your custom features here\n]\n```\n\n### Getting the editor config from an existing field\n\nIf you have access to the sanitized collection config, you can get access to the lexical sanitized editor config & features, as every lexical richText field returns it. Here is an example how you can get it from another field's afterRead hook:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig, RichTextField } from 'payload'\nimport { createHeadlessEditor } from '@lexical/headless'\nimport type { LexicalRichTextAdapter, SanitizedServerEditorConfig } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\nimport {\n  getEnabledNodes,\n  lexicalEditor\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'slug',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'text',\n      type: 'text',\n      hooks: {\n        afterRead: [\n          ({ value, collection }) => {\n            const otherRichTextField: RichTextField = collection.fields.find(\n              (field) => 'name' in field && field.name === 'richText',\n            ) as RichTextField\n\n            const lexicalAdapter: LexicalRichTextAdapter =\n              otherRichTextField.editor as LexicalRichTextAdapter\n\n            const sanitizedServerEditorConfig: SanitizedServerEditorConfig =\n              lexicalAdapter.editorConfig\n\n            const headlessEditor = createHeadlessEditor({\n              nodes: getEnabledNodes({\n                editorConfig: sanitizedServerEditorConfig,\n              }),\n            })\n\n            // Do whatever you want with the headless editor\n\n            return value\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'richText',\n      type: 'richText',\n      editor: lexicalEditor({\n        features,\n      }),\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## HTML => Lexical\n\nOnce you have your headless editor instance, you can use it to convert HTML to Lexical:\n\n```ts\nimport { $generateNodesFromDOM } from '@lexical/html'\nimport { $getRoot, $getSelection } from 'lexical'\nimport { JSDOM } from 'jsdom'\n\nheadlessEditor.update(\n  () => {\n    // In a headless environment you can use a package such as JSDom to parse the HTML string.\n    const dom = new JSDOM(htmlString)\n\n    // Once you have the DOM instance it's easy to generate LexicalNodes.\n    const nodes = $generateNodesFromDOM(headlessEditor, dom.window.document)\n\n    // Select the root\n    $getRoot().select()\n\n    // Insert them at a selection.\n    const selection = $getSelection()\n    selection.insertNodes(nodes)\n  },\n  { discrete: true },\n)\n\n// Do this if you then want to get the editor JSON\nconst editorJSON = headlessEditor.getEditorState().toJSON()\n```\n\nFunctions prefixed with a `$` can only be run inside an `editor.update()` or `editorState.read()` callback.\n\nThis has been taken from the [lexical serialization & deserialization docs](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/serialization#html---lexical).\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Using the <code>discrete: true</code> flag ensures instant updates to the editor state. If\n  immediate reading of the updated state isn't necessary, you can omit the flag.\n</Banner>\n\n## Markdown => Lexical\n\nConvert markdown content to the Lexical editor format with the following:\n\n```ts\nimport { $convertFromMarkdownString } from '@lexical/markdown'\nimport { sanitizeServerEditorConfig } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst yourSanitizedEditorConfig = sanitizeServerEditorConfig(yourEditorConfig, payloadConfig) // <= your editor config & payload config here\nconst markdown = `# Hello World`\n\nheadlessEditor.update(\n  () => {\n    $convertFromMarkdownString(markdown, yourSanitizedEditorConfig.features.markdownTransformers)\n  },\n  { discrete: true },\n)\n\n// Do this if you then want to get the editor JSON\nconst editorJSON = headlessEditor.getEditorState().toJSON()\n```\n\n## Lexical => Markdown\n\nExport content from the Lexical editor into Markdown format using these steps:\n\n1. Import your current editor state into the headless editor.\n2. Convert and fetch the resulting markdown string.\n\nHere's the code for it:\n\n```ts\nimport { $convertToMarkdownString } from '@lexical/markdown'\nimport { sanitizeServerEditorConfig } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\nimport type { SerializedEditorState } from 'lexical'\n\nconst yourSanitizedEditorConfig = sanitizeServerEditorConfig(yourEditorConfig, payloadConfig) // <= your editor config & payload config here\nconst yourEditorState: SerializedEditorState // <= your current editor state here\n\n// Import editor state into your headless editor\ntry {\n  headlessEditor.setEditorState(headlessEditor.parseEditorState(yourEditorState)) // This should commit the editor state immediately\n} catch (e) {\n  logger.error({ err: e }, 'ERROR parsing editor state')\n}\n\n// Export to markdown\nlet markdown: string\nheadlessEditor.getEditorState().read(() => {\n  markdown = $convertToMarkdownString(yourSanitizedEditorConfig?.features?.markdownTransformers)\n})\n```\n\nThe `.setEditorState()` function immediately updates your editor state. Thus, there's no need for the `discrete: true` flag when reading the state afterward.\n\n## Lexical => Plain Text\n\nExport content from the Lexical editor into plain text using these steps:\n\n1. Import your current editor state into the headless editor.\n2. Convert and fetch the resulting plain text string.\n\nHere's the code for it:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SerializedEditorState } from 'lexical'\nimport { $getRoot } from 'lexical'\n\nconst yourEditorState: SerializedEditorState // <= your current editor state here\n\n// Import editor state into your headless editor\ntry {\n  headlessEditor.setEditorState(headlessEditor.parseEditorState(yourEditorState)) // This should commit the editor state immediately\n} catch (e) {\n  logger.error({ err: e }, 'ERROR parsing editor state')\n}\n\n// Export to plain text\nconst plainTextContent =\n  headlessEditor.getEditorState().read(() => {\n    return $getRoot().getTextContent()\n  }) || ''\n```\n",

Depending on the amount of collections, this might take a while.\n\nIMPORTANT: This will overwrite all slate data. We recommend doing the following first:\n1. Take a backup of your entire database. If anything goes wrong and you do not have a backup, you are on your own and will not receive any support.\n2. Make every richText field a lexical editor. This script will only convert lexical richText fields with old Slate data\n3. Add the SlateToLexicalFeature (as seen below) first, and test it out by loading up the admin panel, to see if the migrator works as expected. You might have to build some custom converters for some fields first in order to convert custom Slate nodes. The SlateToLexicalFeature is where the converters are stored. Only fields with this feature added will be migrated.\n\n```ts\nimport { migrateSlateToLexical } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nawait migrateSlateToLexical({ payload })\n```\n\n### Migration via SlateToLexicalFeature\n\nOne way to handle this is to just give your lexical editor the ability to read the slate JSON.\n\nSimply add the `SlateToLexicalFeature` to your editor:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nimport { SlateToLexicalFeature, lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',\n      type: 'richText',\n      editor: lexicalEditor({\n        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [...defaultFeatures, SlateToLexicalFeature({})],\n      }),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nand done! Now, everytime this lexical editor is initialized, it converts the slate date to lexical on-the-fly. If the data is already in lexical format, it will just pass it through.\n\nThis is by far the easiest way to migrate from Slate to Lexical, although it does come with a few caveats:\n\n- There is a performance hit when initializing the lexical editor\n- The editor will still output the Slate data in the output JSON, as the on-the-fly converter only runs for the admin panel\n\nThe easy way to solve this: Edit the richText field and save the document! This overrides the slate data with the lexical data, and the next time the document is loaded, the lexical data will be used. This solves both the performance and the output issue for that specific document. This, however, is a slow and gradual migration process, thus you will have to support both API formats. Especially for a large number of documents, we recommend running the migration script, as explained above.\n\n### Converting custom Slate nodes\n\nIf you have custom Slate nodes, create a custom converter for them. Here's the Upload converter as an example:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SerializedUploadNode } from '../uploadNode.'\nimport type { SlateNodeConverter } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport const SlateUploadConverter: SlateNodeConverter = {\n  converter({ slateNode }) {\n    return {\n      fields: {\n        ...slateNode.fields,\n      },\n      format: '',\n      relationTo: slateNode.relationTo,\n      type: 'upload',\n      value: {\n        id: slateNode.value?.id || '',\n      },\n      version: 1,\n    } as const as SerializedUploadNode\n  },\n  nodeTypes: ['upload'],\n}\n```\n\nIt's pretty simple: You get a Slate node as input, and you return the lexical node. The `nodeTypes` array is used to determine which Slate nodes this converter can handle.\n\nWhen using a migration script, you can add your custom converters to the `converters` property of the `convertSlateToLexical` props, as seen in the example above\n\nWhen using the `SlateToLexicalFeature`, you can add your custom converters to the `converters` property of the `SlateToLexicalFeature` props:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nimport {\n  SlateToLexicalFeature,\n  lexicalEditor,\n  defaultSlateConverters,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nimport { YourCustomConverter } from '../converters/YourCustomConverter'\n\nconst Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',\n      type: 'richText',\n      editor: lexicalEditor({\n        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [\n          ...defaultFeatures,\n          SlateToLexicalFeature({\n            converters: [...defaultSlateConverters, YourCustomConverter],\n          }),\n        ],\n      }),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Migrating from payload-plugin-lexical\n\nMigrating from [payload-plugin-lexical](https://github.com/AlessioGr/payload-plugin-lexical) works similar to migrating from Slate.\n\nInstead of a `SlateToLexicalFeature` there is a `LexicalPluginToLexicalFeature` you can use. And instead of `convertSlateToLexical` you can use `convertLexicalPluginToLexical`.\n\n## Migrating lexical data from old version to new version\n\nEach lexical node has a `version` property which is saved in the database. Every time we make a breaking change to the node's data, we increment the version. This way, we can detect an old version and automatically convert old data to the new format once you open up the editor.\n\nThe problem is, this migration only happens when you open the editor, modify the richText field (so that the field's `setValue` function is called) and save the document. Until you do that for all documents, some documents will still have the old data.\n\nTo solve this, we export an `upgradeLexicalData` function which goes through every single document in your payload app and re-saves it, if it has a lexical editor. This way, the data is automatically converted to the new format, and that automatic conversion gets applied to every single document in your app.\n\nIMPORTANT: Take a backup of your entire database. If anything goes wrong and you do not have a backup, you are on your own and will not receive any support.\n\n```ts\nimport { upgradeLexicalData } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nawait upgradeLexicalData({ payload })\n```\n",

        "content": "\nBefore you begin building custom features for Lexical, it is crucial to familiarize yourself with the [Lexical docs](https://lexical.dev/docs/intro), particularly the \"Concepts\" section. This foundation is necessary for understanding Lexical's core principles, such as nodes, editor state, and commands.\n\nLexical features are designed to be modular, meaning each piece of functionality is encapsulated within just two specific interfaces: one for server-side code and one for client-side code.\n\nBy convention, these are named feature.server.ts for server-side functionality and feature.client.ts for client-side functionality. The primary functionality is housed within feature.server.ts, which users will import into their projects. The client-side feature, although defined separately, is integrated and rendered server-side through the server feature. That way, we still maintain a clear boundary between server and client code, while also centralizing the code needed for a feature in basically one place. This approach is beneficial for managing all the bits and pieces which make up your feature as a whole, such as toolbar entries, buttons, or new nodes, allowing each feature to be neatly contained and managed independently.\n\n\n## Server Feature\n\nTo start building new features, you should start with the server feature, which is the entry-point.\n\n**Example myFeature/feature.server.ts:**\n\n```ts\nimport { createServerFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';\n\nexport const MyFeature = createServerFeature({\n  feature: {\n  },\n  key: 'myFeature',\n})\n```\n\n`createServerFeature` is a helper function which lets you create new features without boilerplate code.\n\nNow, the feature is ready to be used in the editor:\n\n```ts\nimport { MyFeature } from './myFeature/feature.server';\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate';\n\n//...\n {\n    name: 'richText',\n    type: 'richText',\n    editor: lexicalEditor({\n      features: [\n        MyFeature(),\n      ],\n    }),\n },\n```\n\nBy default, this server feature does nothing - you haven't added any functionality yet. Depending on what you want your\nfeature to do, the ServerFeature type exposes various properties you can set to inject custom functionality into the lexical editor.\n\n### i18n\n\nEach feature can register their own translations, which are automatically scoped to the feature key:\n\n```ts\nimport { createServerFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';\n\n\nexport const MyFeature = createServerFeature({\n  feature: {\n    i18n: {\n      en: {\n        label: 'My Feature',\n      },\n      de: {\n        label: 'Mein Feature',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  key: 'myFeature',\n})\n```\n\nThis allows you to add i18n translations scoped to your feature. This specific example translation will be available under `lexical:myFeature:label` - `myFeature` being your feature key.\n\n### Markdown Transformers\n\nThe Server Feature, just like the Client Feature, allows you to add markdown transformers. Markdown transformers on the server are used when [converting the editor from or to markdown](../lexical/converters#markdown-lexical).\n\n```ts\nimport { createServerFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';\nimport type { ElementTransformer } from '@lexical/markdown'\nimport {\n  $createMyNode,\n  $isMyNode,\n  MyNode\n} from './nodes/MyNode'\n\nconst MyMarkdownTransformer: ElementTransformer = {\n  type: 'element',\n  dependencies: [MyNode],\n  export: (node, exportChildren) => {\n    if (!$isMyNode(node)) {\n      return null\n    }\n    return '+++'\n  },\n  // match ---\n  regExp: /^+++\\s*$/,\n  replace: (parentNode) => {\n    const node = $createMyNode()\n    if (node) {\n      parentNode.replace(node)\n    }\n  },\n}\n\n\nexport const MyFeature = createServerFeature({\n  feature: {\n    markdownTransformers: [MyMarkdownTransformer],\n  },\n  key: 'myFeature',\n})\n```\n\nIn this example, the node will be outputted as `+++` in Markdown, and the markdown `+++` will be converted to a `MyNode` node in the editor.\n\n### Nodes\n\nWhile nodes added to the server feature do not control how the node is rendered in the editor, they control other aspects of the node:\n- HTML conversion\n- Node Hooks\n- Sub fields\n- Behavior in a headless editor\n\nThe `createNode` helper function is used to create nodes with proper typing. It is recommended to use this function to create nodes.\n\n```ts\nimport { createServerFeature, createNode } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';\nimport {\n  MyNode\n} from './nodes/MyNode'\n\nexport const MyFeature = createServerFeature({\n  feature: {\n\n    nodes: [\n      // Use the createNode helper function to more easily create nodes with proper typing\n      createNode({\n        converters: {\n          html: {\n            converter: () => {\n              return `<hr/>`\n            },\n            nodeTypes: [MyNode.getType()],\n          },\n        },\n        // Here you can add your actual node. On the server, they will be\n        // used to initialize a headless editor which can be used to perform\n        // operations on the editor, like markdown / html conversion.\n        node: MyNode,\n      }),\n    ],\n  },\n  key: 'myFeature',\n})\n```\n\nWhile nodes in the client feature are added by themselves to the nodes array, nodes in the server feature can be added together with the following sibling options:\n\n| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`getSubFields`**              | If a node includes sub-fields (e.g. block and link nodes), passing the subFields schema here will make payload automatically populate & run hooks for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **`getSubFieldsData`**          | If a node includes sub-fields, the sub-fields data needs to be returned here, alongside `getSubFields` which returns their schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| **`graphQLPopulationPromises`** | Allows you to run population logic when a node's data was requested from GraphQL. While `getSubFields` and `getSubFieldsData` automatically handle populating sub-fields (since they run hooks on them), those are only populated in the Rest API. This is because the Rest API hooks do not have access to the 'depth' property provided by GraphQL. In order for them to be populated correctly in GraphQL, the population logic needs to be provided here. |\n| **`node`**                      | The actual lexical node needs to be provided here. This also supports [lexical node replacements](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/node-replacement).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **`validations`**               | This allows you to provide node validations, which are run when your document is being validated, alongside other payload fields. You can use it to throw a validation error for a specific node in case its data is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **`converters`**                | Allows you to define how a node can be serialized into different formats. Currently, only supports HTML. Markdown converters are defined in `markdownTransformers` and not here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| **`hooks`**                     | Just like payload fields, you can provide hooks which are run for this specific node. These are called Node Hooks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n### Feature load order\n\nServer features can also accept a function as the `feature` property (useful for sanitizing props, as mentioned below). This function will be called when the feature is loaded during the payload sanitization process:\n\n```ts\nimport { createServerFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';\n\ncreateServerFeature({\n  //...\n  feature: async ({ config, isRoot, props, resolvedFeatures, unSanitizedEditorConfig, featureProviderMap }) => {\n\n    return {\n      //Actual server feature here...\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\"Loading\" here means the process of calling this `feature` function. By default, features are called in the order in which they are added to the editor.\nHowever, sometimes you might want to load a feature after another feature has been loaded, or require a different feature to be loaded, throwing an error if this is not the case.\n\nWithin lexical, one example where this is done are our list features. Both `UnorderedListFeature` and `OrderedListFeature` register the same `ListItem` node. Within `UnorderedListFeature` we register it normally, but within `OrderedListFeature` we want to only register the `ListItem` node if the `UnorderedListFeature` is not present - otherwise, we would have two features registering the same node.\n\nHere is how we do it:\n\n```ts\nimport { createServerFeature, createNode } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';\n\nexport const OrderedListFeature = createServerFeature({\n  feature: ({ featureProviderMap }) => {\n    return {\n      // ...\n      nodes: featureProviderMap.has('unorderedList')\n        ? []\n        : [\n            createNode({\n              // ...\n            }),\n          ],\n    }\n  },\n  key: 'orderedList',\n})\n```\n\n`featureProviderMap` will always be available and contain all the features, even yet-to-be-loaded ones, so we can check if a feature is loaded by checking if its `key` present in the map.\n\nIf you wanted to make sure a feature is loaded before another feature, you can use the `dependenciesPriority` property:\n\n```ts\nimport { createServerFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';\n\nexport const MyFeature = createServerFeature({\n  feature: ({ featureProviderMap }) => {\n    return {\n      // ...\n    }\n  },\n  key: 'myFeature',\n  dependenciesPriority: ['otherFeature'],\n})\n```\n\n| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`dependenciesSoft`**     | Keys of soft-dependencies needed for this feature. These are optional. Payload will attempt to load them before this feature, but doesn't throw an error if that's not possible.                          |\n| **`dependencies`**         | Keys of dependencies needed for this feature. These dependencies do not have to be loaded first, but they have to exist, otherwise an error will be thrown.                                               |\n| **`dependenciesPriority`** | Keys of priority dependencies needed for this feature. These dependencies have to be loaded first AND have to exist, otherwise an error will be thrown. They will be available in the `feature` property. |\n\n## Client Feature\n\nMost of the functionality which the user actually sees and interacts with, like toolbar items and React components for nodes, resides on the client-side.\n\nTo set up your client-side feature, follow these three steps:\n\n1. **Create a Separate File**: Start by creating a new file specifically for your client feature, such as `myFeature/feature.client.ts`. It's important to keep client and server features in separate files to maintain a clean boundary between server and client code.\n2. **'use client'**: Mark that file with a 'use client' directive at the top of the file\n3. **Register the Client Feature**: Register the client feature within your server feature, by passing it to the `ClientFeature` prop. This is needed because the server feature is the sole entry-point of your feature. This also means you are not able to create a client feature without a server feature, as you will not be able to register it otherwise.\n\n**Example myFeature/feature.client.ts:**\n\n```ts\n'use client'\n\nimport { createClientFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client';\n\nexport const MyClientFeature = createClientFeature({\n\n})\n```\n\nExplore the APIs available through ClientFeature to add the specific functionality you need. Remember, do not import directly from `'@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'` when working on the client-side, as it will cause errors with webpack or turbopack. Instead, use `'@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client'` for all client-side imports. Type-imports are excluded from this rule and can always be imported.\n\n### Nodes\n\nAdd nodes to the `nodes` array in **both** your client & server feature. On the server side, nodes are utilized for backend operations like HTML conversion in a headless editor. On the client side, these nodes are integral to how content is displayed and managed in the editor, influencing how they are rendered, behave, and saved in the database.\n\nExample:\n\n**myFeature/feature.client.ts:**\n\n```ts\n'use client'\n\nimport { createClientFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client';\nimport { MyNode } from './nodes/MyNode';\n\nexport const MyClientFeature = createClientFeature({\n  nodes: [MyNode]\n})\n```\n\nThis also supports [lexical node replacements](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/node-replacement).\n\n**myFeature/nodes/MyNode.tsx:**\n\nHere is a basic DecoratorNode example:\n\n```ts\nimport type {\n  DOMConversionMap,\n  DOMConversionOutput,\n  DOMExportOutput,\n  EditorConfig,\n  LexicalNode,\n  SerializedLexicalNode,\n} from 'lexical'\n\nimport { $applyNodeReplacement, DecoratorNode } from 'lexical'\n\n// SerializedLexicalNode is the default lexical node.\n// By setting your SerializedMyNode type to SerializedLexicalNode,\n// you are basically saying that this node does not save any additional data.\n// If you want your node to save data, feel free to extend it\nexport type SerializedMyNode = SerializedLexicalNode\n\n// Lazy-import the React component to your node here\nconst MyNodeComponent = React.lazy(() =>\n  import('../component/index.js').then((module) => ({\n    default: module.MyNodeComponent,\n  })),\n)\n\n/**\n * This node is a DecoratorNode. DecoratorNodes allow you to render React components in the editor.\n *\n * They need both createDom and decorate functions. createDom => outside of the html. decorate => React Component inside of the html.\n *\n * If we used DecoratorBlockNode instead, we would only need a decorate method\n */\nexport class MyNode extends DecoratorNode<React.ReactElement> {\n  static clone(node: MyNode): MyNode {\n    return new MyNode(node.__key)\n  }\n\n  static getType(): string {\n    return 'myNode'\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Defines what happens if you copy a div element from another page and paste it into the lexical editor\n   *\n   * This also determines the behavior of lexical's internal HTML -> Lexical converter\n   */\n  static importDOM(): DOMConversionMap | null {\n    return {\n      div: () => ({\n        conversion: $yourConversionMethod,\n        priority: 0,\n      }),\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * The data for this node is stored serialized as JSON.

This is only the \"initial\" / \"outer\" HTML element.\n   */\n  createDOM(config: EditorConfig): HTMLElement {\n    const element = document.createElement('div')\n    return element\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Allows you to render a React component within whatever createDOM returns.\n   */\n  decorate(): React.ReactElement {\n    return <MyNodeComponent nodeKey={this.__key} />\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Opposite of importDOM, this function defines what happens when you copy a div element from the lexical editor and paste it into another page.\n   *\n   * This also determines the behavior of lexical's internal Lexical -> HTML converter\n   */\n  exportDOM(): DOMExportOutput {\n    return { element: document.createElement('div') }\n  }\n  /**\n   * Opposite of importJSON. This determines what data is saved in the database / in the lexical editor state.\n   */\n  exportJSON(): SerializedLexicalNode {\n    return {\n      type: 'myNode',\n      version: 1,\n    }\n  }\n\n  getTextContent(): string {\n    return '\\n'\n  }\n\n  isInline(): false {\n    return false\n  }\n\n  updateDOM(): boolean {\n    return false\n  }\n}\n\n// This is used in the importDOM method. Totally optional if you do not want your node to be created automatically when copy & pasting certain dom elements\n// into your editor.\nfunction $yourConversionMethod(): DOMConversionOutput {\n  return { node: $createMyNode() }\n}\n\n// This is a utility method to create a new MyNode. Utility methods prefixed with $ make it explicit that this should only be used within lexical\nexport function $createMyNode(): MyNode {\n  return $applyNodeReplacement(new MyNode())\n}\n\n// This is just a utility method you can use to check if a node is a MyNode. This also ensures correct typing.\nexport function $isMyNode(\n  node: LexicalNode | null | undefined,\n): node is MyNode {\n  return node instanceof MyNode\n}\n```\n\nPlease do not add any 'use client' directives to your nodes, as the node class can be used on the server.\n\n### Plugins\n\nOne small part of a feature are plugins. The name stems from the lexical playground plugins and is just a small part of a lexical feature.\nPlugins are simply React components which are added to the editor, within all the lexical context providers. They can be used to add any functionality\nto the editor, by utilizing the lexical API.\n\nMost commonly, they are used to register [lexical listeners](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/listeners), [node transforms](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/transforms) or [commands](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/commands).\nFor example, you could add a drawer to your plugin and register a command which opens it. That command can then be called from anywhere within lexical, e.g. from within your custom lexical node.\n\nTo add a plugin, simply add it to the `plugins` array in your client feature:\n\n```ts\n'use client'\n\nimport { createClientFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client';\nimport { MyPlugin } from './plugin';\n\nexport const MyClientFeature = createClientFeature({\n  plugins: [MyPlugin]\n})\n```\n\nExample plugin.tsx:\n\n```ts\n'use client'\nimport type {\n  LexicalCommand,\n} from 'lexical'\n\nimport {\n  createCommand,\n  $getSelection,\n  $isRangeSelection,\n  COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR\n} from 'lexical'\n\nimport { useLexicalComposerContext } from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext.js'\nimport { $insertNodeToNearestRoot } from '@lexical/utils'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n\nimport type { PluginComponent } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical' // type imports can be imported from @payloadcms/richtext-lexical - even on the client\n\nimport {\n  $createMyNode,\n} from '../nodes/MyNode'\nimport './index.scss'\n\nexport const INSERT_MYNODE_COMMAND: LexicalCommand<void> = createCommand(\n  'INSERT_MYNODE_COMMAND',\n)\n\n/**\n * Plugin which registers a lexical command to insert a new MyNode into the editor\n */\nexport const MyNodePlugin: PluginComponent= () => {\n  // The useLexicalComposerContext hook can be used to access the lexical editor instance\n  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    return editor.registerCommand(\n      INSERT_MYNODE_COMMAND,\n      (type) => {\n        const selection = $getSelection()\n\n        if (!$isRangeSelection(selection)) {\n          return false\n        }\n\n        const focusNode = selection.focus.getNode()\n\n        if (focusNode !== null) {\n          const newMyNode = $createMyNode()\n          $insertNodeToNearestRoot(newMyNode)\n        }\n\n        return true\n      },\n      COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR,\n    )\n  }, [editor])\n\n  return null\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we register a lexical command, which simply inserts a new MyNode into the editor. This command can be called from anywhere within lexical, e.g. from within a custom node.\n\n### Toolbar groups\n\nToolbar groups are visual containers which hold toolbar items. There are different toolbar group types which determine *how* a toolbar item is displayed: `dropdown` and `buttons`.\n\nAll the default toolbar groups are exported from `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client`. You can use them to add your own toolbar items to the editor:\n- Dropdown: `toolbarAddDropdownGroupWithItems`\n- Dropdown: `toolbarTextDropdownGroupWithItems`\n- Buttons: `toolbarFormatGroupWithItems`\n- Buttons: `toolbarFeatureButtonsGroupWithItems`\n\nWithin dropdown groups, items are positioned vertically when the dropdown is opened and include the icon & label. Within button groups, items are positioned horizontally and only include the icon. If a toolbar group with the same key is declared twice, all its items will be merged into one group.\n\n#### Custom buttons toolbar group\n\n| Option      | Description                                                                                                                                            |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`items`** | All toolbar items part of this toolbar group need to be added here.                                                                                    |\n| **`key`**   | Each toolbar group needs to have a unique key. Groups with the same keys will have their items merged together.                                        |\n| **`order`** | Determines where the toolbar group will be.                                                                                                            |\n| **`type`**  | Controls the toolbar group type. Set to `buttons` to create a buttons toolbar group, which displays toolbar items horizontally using only their icons. |\n\nExample:\n```ts\nimport type { ToolbarGroup, ToolbarGroupItem } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport const toolbarFormatGroupWithItems = (items: ToolbarGroupItem[]): ToolbarGroup => {\n  return {\n    type: 'buttons',\n    items,\n    key: 'myButtonsToolbar',\n    order: 10,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Custom dropdown toolbar group\n\n| Option               | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`items`**          | All toolbar items part of this toolbar group need to be added here.                                                                                                                  |\n| **`key`**            | Each toolbar group needs to have a unique key. Groups with the same keys will have their items merged together.                                                                      |\n| **`order`**          | Determines where the toolbar group will be.                                                                                                                                          |\n| **`type`**           | Controls the toolbar group type. Set to `dropdown` to create a buttons toolbar group, which displays toolbar items vertically using their icons and labels, if the dropdown is open. |\n| **`ChildComponent`** | The dropdown toolbar ChildComponent allows you to pass in a React Component which will be displayed within the dropdown button.                                                      |\n\nExample:\n```ts\nimport type { ToolbarGroup, ToolbarGroupItem } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nimport { MyIcon } from './icons/MyIcon'\n\nexport const toolbarAddDropdownGroupWithItems = (items: ToolbarGroupItem[]): ToolbarGroup => {\n  return {\n    type: 'dropdown',\n    ChildComponent: MyIcon,\n    items,\n    key: 'myDropdownToolbar',\n    order: 10,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Toolbar items\n\nCustom nodes and features on its own are pointless, if they can't be added to the editor. You will need to hook in one of our interfaces which allow the user to interact with the editor:\n\n- Fixed toolbar which stays fixed at the top of the editor\n- Inline, floating toolbar which appears when selecting text\n- Slash menu which appears when typing `/` in the editor\n- Markdown transformers, which are triggered when a certain text pattern is typed in the editor\n- Or any other interfaces which can be added via your own plugins. Our toolbars are a prime example of this - they are just plugins.\n\nTo add a toolbar item to either the floating or the inline toolbar, you can add a ToolbarGroup with a ToolbarItem to the `toolbarFixed` or `toolbarInline` props of your client feature:\n\n```ts\n'use client'\n\nimport { createClientFeature, toolbarAddDropdownGroupWithItems } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client';\nimport { IconComponent } from './icon';\nimport { $isHorizontalRuleNode } from './nodes/MyNode';\nimport { INSERT_MYNODE_COMMAND } from './plugin';\nimport { $isNodeSelection } from 'lexical'\n\nexport const MyClientFeature = createClientFeature({\n   toolbarFixed: {\n    groups: [\n      toolbarAddDropdownGroupWithItems([\n        {\n          ChildComponent: IconComponent,\n          isActive: ({ selection }) => {\n            if (!$isNodeSelection(selection) || !selection.getNodes().length) {\n              return false\n            }\n\n            const firstNode = selection.getNodes()[0]\n            return $isHorizontalRuleNode(firstNode)\n          },\n          key: 'myNode',\n          label: ({ i18n }) => {\n            return i18n.t('lexical:myFeature:label')\n          },\n          onSelect: ({ editor }) => {\n            editor.dispatchCommand(INSERT_MYNODE_COMMAND, undefined)\n          },\n        },\n      ]),\n    ],\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou will have to provide a toolbar group first, and then the items for that toolbar group (more on that above).\n\nA `ToolbarItem` various props you can use to customize its behavior:\n\n| Option               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`ChildComponent`** | A React component which is rendered within your toolbar item's default button component. Usually, you want this to be an icon.                                                             |\n| **`Component`**      | A React component which is rendered in place of the toolbar item's default button component, thus completely replacing it. The `ChildComponent` and `onSelect` properties will be ignored. |\n| **`label`**          | The label will be displayed in your toolbar item, if it's within a dropdown group. To make use of i18n, this can be a function.                                                            |\n| **`key`**            | Each toolbar item needs to have a unique key.                                                                                                                                              |\n| **`onSelect`**       | A function which is called when the toolbar item is clicked.                                                                                                                               |\n| **`isEnabled`**      | This is optional and controls if the toolbar item is clickable or not. If `false` is returned here, it will be grayed out and unclickable.                                                 |\n| **`isActive`**       | This is optional and controls if the toolbar item is highlighted or not                                                                                                                    |\n\nThe API for adding an item to the floating inline toolbar (`toolbarInline`) is identical. If you wanted to add an item to both the fixed and inline toolbar, you can extract it into its own variable\n(typed as `ToolbarGroup[]`) and add it to both the `toolbarFixed` and `toolbarInline` props.\n\n### Slash Menu groups\n\nWe're exporting `slashMenuBasicGroupWithItems` from `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client` which you can use to add items to the slash menu labelled \"Basic\". If you want to create your own slash menu group, here is an example:\n\n```ts\nimport type {\n  SlashMenuGroup,\n  SlashMenuItem,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport function mwnSlashMenuGroupWithItems(items: SlashMenuItem[]): SlashMenuGroup {\n  return {\n    items,\n    key: 'myGroup',\n    label: 'My Group' // <= This can be a function to make use of i18n\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy creating a helper function like this, you can easily re-use it and add items to it. All Slash Menu groups with the same keys will have their items merged together.\n\n| Option      | Description                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`items`** | An array of `SlashMenuItem`'s which will be displayed in the slash menu.                                                              |\n| **`label`** | The label will be displayed before your Slash Menu group. In order to make use of i18n, this can be a function.                       |\n| **`key`**   | Used for class names and, if label is not provided, for display. Slash menus with the same key will have their items merged together. |\n\n\n### Slash Menu items\n\nThe API for adding items to the slash menu is similar. There are slash menu groups, and each slash menu groups has items. Here is an example:\n\n```ts\n'use client'\n\nimport { createClientFeature, slashMenuBasicGroupWithItems } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client';\nimport { INSERT_MYNODE_COMMAND } from './plugin';\nimport { IconComponent } from './icon';\n\nexport const MyClientFeature = createClientFeature({\n  slashMenu: {\n    groups: [\n      slashMenuBasicGroupWithItems([\n        {\n          Icon: IconComponent,\n          key: 'myNode',\n          keywords: ['myNode', 'myFeature', 'someOtherKeyword'],\n          label: ({ i18n }) => {\n            return i18n.t('lexical:myFeature:label')\n          },\n          onSelect: ({ editor }) => {\n            editor.dispatchCommand(INSERT_MYNODE_COMMAND, undefined)\n          },\n        },\n      ]),\n    ],\n  },\n})\n```\n\n| Option         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`Icon`**     | The icon which is rendered in your slash menu item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **`label`**    | The label will be displayed in your slash menu item. In order to make use of i18n, this can be a function.                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **`key`**      | Each slash menu item needs to have a unique key. The key will be matched when typing, displayed if no `label` property is set, and used for classNames.                                                                                                                           |\n| **`onSelect`** | A function which is called when the slash menu item is selected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| **`keywords`** | Keywords are used to match the item for different texts typed after the '/'. E.g. you might want to show a horizontal rule item if you type both /hr, /separator, /horizontal etc. In addition to the keywords, the label and key will be used to find the right slash menu item. |\n\n\n### Markdown Transformers\n\nThe Client Feature, just like the Server Feature, allows you to add markdown transformers. Markdown transformers on the client are used to create new nodes when a certain markdown pattern is typed in the editor.\n\n```ts\nimport { createClientFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client';\nimport type { ElementTransformer } from '@lexical/markdown'\nimport {\n  $createMyNode,\n  $isMyNode,\n  MyNode\n} from './nodes/MyNode'\n\nconst MyMarkdownTransformer: ElementTransformer = {\n  type: 'element',\n  dependencies: [MyNode],\n  export: (node, exportChildren) => {\n    if (!$isMyNode(node)) {\n      return null\n    }\n    return '+++'\n  },\n  // match ---\n  regExp: /^+++\\s*$/,\n  replace: (parentNode) => {\n    const node = $createMyNode()\n    if (node) {\n      parentNode.replace(node)\n    }\n  },\n}\n\n\nexport const MyFeature = createClientFeature({\n  markdownTransformers: [MyMarkdownTransformer],\n})\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `MyNode` will be inserted into the editor when `+++ ` is typed.\n\n### Providers\n\nYou can add providers to your client feature, which will be nested below the `EditorConfigProvider`. This can be useful if you want to provide some context to your nodes or other parts of your feature.\n\n```ts\n'use client'\n\nimport { createClientFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client';\nimport { TableContext } from './context';\n\nexport const MyClientFeature = createClientFeature({\n    providers: [TableContext],\n})\n```\n\n## Props\n\nTo accept props in your feature, type them as a generic.\n\nServer Feature:\n\n```ts\ncreateServerFeature<UnSanitizedProps, SanitizedProps, UnSanitizedClientProps>({\n  //...\n})\n```\n\nClient Feature:\n\n```ts\ncreateClientFeature<UnSanitizedClientProps, SanitizedClientProps>({\n  //...\n})\n```\n\nThe unSanitized props are what the user will pass to the feature when they call its provider function and add it to their editor config. You then have an option to sanitize those props.\nTo sanitize those in the server feature, you can pass a function to `feature` instead of an object:\n\n```ts\ncreateServerFeature<UnSanitizedProps, SanitizedProps, UnSanitizedClientProps>({\n  //...\n  feature: async ({ config, isRoot, props, resolvedFeatures, unSanitizedEditorConfig, featureProviderMap }) => {\n    const sanitizedProps = doSomethingWithProps(props)\n\n    return {\n      sanitizedServerFeatureProps: sanitizedProps,\n      //Actual server feature here...\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nKeep in mind that any sanitized props then have to be returned in the `sanitizedServerFeatureProps` property.\n\nIn the client feature, it works similarly:\n\n```ts\ncreateClientFeature<UnSanitizedClientProps, SanitizedClientProps>(\n  ({ clientFunctions, featureProviderMap, props, resolvedFeatures, unSanitizedEditorConfig }) => {\n    const sanitizedProps = doSomethingWithProps(props)\n    return {\n      sanitizedClientFeatureProps:  sanitizedProps,\n      //Actual client feature here...\n    }\n  },\n)\n```\n\n### Bringing props from the server to the client\n\nBy default, the client feature will never receive any props from the server feature. In order to pass props from the server to the client, you can need to return those props in the server feature:\n\n```ts\ntype UnSanitizedClientProps = {\n  test: string\n}\n\ncreateServerFeature<UnSanitizedProps, SanitizedProps, UnSanitizedClientProps>({\n  //...\n  feature: {\n    clientFeatureProps: {\n      test: 'myValue'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe reason the client feature does not have the same props available as the server by default is because all client props need to be serializable. You can totally accept things like functions or Maps as props in your server feature, but you will not be able to send those to the client. In the end, those props are sent from the server to the client over the network, so they need to be serializable.\n\n## More information\n\nHave a look at the [features we've already built](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/packages/richtext-lexical/src/features) - understanding how they work will help you understand how to create your own. There is no difference between the features included by default and the ones you create yourself - since those features are all isolated from the \"core\", you have access to the same APIs, whether the feature is part of payload or not!\n",

      {
        "content": "\nWith Live Preview you can render your front-end application directly within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). As you type, your changes take effect in real-time. No need to save a draft or publish your changes. This works in both [Server-side](./server) as well as [Client-side](./client) environments.\n\nLive Preview works by rendering an iframe on the page that loads your front-end application. The Admin Panel communicates with your app through [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) events. These events are emitted every time a change is made to the document. Your app then listens for these events and re-renders itself with the data it receives.\n\n{/* IMAGE OF LIVE PREVIEW HERE */}\n\n## Setup\n\nSetting up Live Preview is easy. This can be done either globally through the [Root Config](../configuration/overview), or on individual [Collection](../configuration/collections) and [Global](../configuration/globals) configs. Once configured, a new \"Live Preview\" tab will appear at the top of enabled documents. Navigating to this tab opens the preview window and loads your front-end application.\n\nTo add Live Preview, use the `admin.livePreview` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    // highlight-start\n    livePreview: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000', // The URL to your front-end, this can also be a function (see below)\n      collections: ['pages'], // The Collection(s) to enable Live Preview on (Globals are also possible)\n    },\n    // highlight-end\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| Path              | Description                                                                                                                                           |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`url`** \\*      | String, or function that returns a string, pointing to your front-end application. This value is used as the iframe `src`. [More details](#url).      |\n| **`breakpoints`** | Array of breakpoints to be used as “device sizes” in the preview window. Each item appears as an option in the toolbar. [More details](#breakpoints). |\n| **`collections`** | Array of collection slugs to enable Live Preview on.                                                                                                  |\n| **`globals`**     | Array of global slugs to enable Live Preview on.                                                                                                      |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  Alternatively, you can define the <code>admin.livePreview</code> property on individual [Collection](../configuration/collections) and [Global](../configuration/globals) configs. Settings defined here will be merged into the top-level as overrides.\n</Banner>\n\n### URL\n\nThe `url` property is a string that points to your front-end application. This value is used as the `src` attribute of the iframe rendering your front-end. Once loaded, the Admin Panel will communicate directly with your app through `window.postMessage` events.\n\nTo set the URL, use the `admin.livePreview.url` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    livePreview: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000', // highlight-line\n      collections: ['pages'],\n    },\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Dynamic URLs\n\nYou can also pass a function in order to dynamically format URLs. This is useful for multi-tenant applications, localization, or any other scenario where the URL needs to be generated based on the document being edited.\n\nTo set dynamic URLs, set the `admin.livePreview.url` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview) to a function:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    livePreview: {\n      // highlight-start\n      url: ({\n        data,\n        documentInfo,\n        locale\n      }) => `${data.tenant.url}${ // Multi-tenant top-level domain\n        documentInfo.slug === 'posts' ? `/posts/${data.slug}` : `${data.slug !== 'home' : `/${data.slug}` : ''}`\n      }${locale ? `?locale=${locale?.code}` : ''}`, // Localization query param\n      collections: ['pages'],\n    },\n    // highlight-end\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe following arguments are provided to the `url` function:\n\n| Path               | Description                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`data`**         | The data of the document being edited. This includes changes that have not yet been saved.                        |\n| **`documentInfo`** | Information about the document being edited like collection slug. [More details](../admin/hooks#usedocumentinfo). |\n| **`locale`**       | The locale currently being edited (if applicable). [More details](../configuration/localization).                 |\n\n### Breakpoints\n\nThe breakpoints property is an array of objects which are used as “device sizes” in the preview window. Each item will render as an option in the toolbar. When selected, the preview window will resize to the exact dimensions specified in that breakpoint.\n\nTo set breakpoints, use the `admin.livePreview.breakpoints` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    livePreview: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n      // highlight-start\n      breakpoints: [\n        {\n          label: 'Mobile',\n          name: 'mobile',\n          width: 375,\n          height: 667,\n        },\n      ],\n      // highlight-end\n    },\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe following options are available for each breakpoint:\n\n| Path            | Description                                                                 |\n| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`label`** \\*  | The label to display in the drop-down. This is what the user will see.      |\n| **`name`** \\*   | The name of the breakpoint.                                                 |\n| **`width`** \\*  | The width of the breakpoint. This is used to set the width of the iframe.   |\n| **`height`** \\* | The height of the breakpoint. This is used to set the height of the iframe. |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n{/* IMAGE OF TOOLBAR HERE */}\n\nThe \"Responsive\" option is always available in the drop-down and requires no additional configuration. This is the default breakpoint that will be used on initial load. This option styles the iframe with a width and height of `100%` so that it fills the screen at its maximum size and automatically resizes as the window changes size.\n\nYou may also explicitly resize the Live Preview by using the corresponding inputs in the toolbar. This will temporarily override the breakpoint selection to \"Custom\" until a predefined breakpoint is selected once again.\n\nIf you prefer to freely resize the Live Preview without the use of breakpoints, you can open it in a new window by clicking the button in the toolbar. This will close the iframe and open a new window which can be resized as you wish. Closing it will automatically re-open the iframe.\n\n## Example\n\nFor a working demonstration of this, check out the official [Live Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload).\n",

        "content": "\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Server-side Live Preview is only for front-end frameworks that support the concept of Server Components, i.e. [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components). If your front-end application is built with a client-side framework like the [Next.js Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com), [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org), etc., see [client-side Live Preview](./client).\n</Banner>\n\nServer-side Live Preview works by making a roundtrip to the server every time your document is saved, i.e. draft save, autosave, or publish. While using Live Preview, the Admin panel emits a new `window.postMessage` event which your front-end application can use to invoke this process. In Next.js, this means simply calling `router.refresh()` which will hydrate the HTML using new data straight from the [Local API](../local-api/overview).\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  It is recommended that you enable [Autosave](../versions/autosave) alongside Live Preview to make the experience feel more responsive.\n</Banner>\n\nIf your front-end application is built with [React](#react), you can use the `RefreshRouteOnChange` function that Payload provides. In the future, all other major frameworks like Vue and Svelte will be officially supported. If you are using any of these frameworks today, you can still integrate with Live Preview yourself using the underlying tooling that Payload provides. See [building your own router refresh component](#building-your-own-router-refresh-component) for more information.\n\n## React\n\nIf your front-end application is built with server-side [React](https://react.dev) like [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), you can use the `RefreshRouteOnSave` component that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the `@payloadcms/live-preview-react` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview-react\n```\n\nThen, render the `RefreshRouteOnSave` component anywhere in your `page.tsx`. Here's an example:\n\n`page.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nimport { RefreshRouteOnSave } from './RefreshRouteOnSave.tsx'\nimport { getPayloadHMR } from '@payloadcms/next'\nimport config from '../payload.config'\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const payload = await getPayloadHMR({ config })\n\n  const page = await payload.findByID({\n    collection: 'pages',\n    id: '123',\n    draft: true\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <Fragment>\n      <RefreshRouteOnSave />\n      <h1>{page.title}</h1>\n    </Fragment>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n`RefreshRouteOnSave.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { RefreshRouteOnSave as PayloadLivePreview } from '@payloadcms/live-preview-react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation.js'\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport const RefreshRouteOnSave: React.FC = () => {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <PayloadLivePreview\n      refresh={() => router.refresh()}\n      serverURL={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_URL}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Building your own router refresh component\n\nNo matter what front-end framework you are using, you can build your own component using the same underlying tooling that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the base `@payloadcms/live-preview` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview\n```\n\nThis package provides the following functions:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **`ready`**           | Sends a `window.postMessage` event to the Admin panel to indicate that the front-end is ready to receive messages.                         |\n| **`isDocumentEvent`** | Checks if a `MessageEvent` originates from the Admin panel and is a document-level event, i.e. draft save, autosave, publish, etc.         |\n\nWith these functions, you can build your own hook using your front-end framework of choice:\n\n```tsx\nimport { ready, isDocumentEvent } from '@payloadcms/live-preview'\n\n// To build your own component:\n// 1. Listen for document-level `window.postMessage` events sent from the Admin panel\n// 2. Tell the Admin panel when it is ready to receive messages\n// 3. Refresh the route every time a new document-level event is received\n// 4. Unsubscribe from the `window.postMessage` events when it unmounts\n```\n\nHere is an example of what the same `RefreshRouteOnSave` React component from above looks like under the hood:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport type React from 'react'\n\nimport { isDocumentEvent, ready } from '@payloadcms/live-preview'\nimport { useCallback, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'\n\nexport const RefreshRouteOnSave: React.FC<{\n  apiRoute?: string\n  depth?: number\n  refresh: () => void\n  serverURL: string\n}> = (props) => {\n  const { apiRoute, depth, refresh, serverURL } = props\n  const hasSentReadyMessage = useRef<boolean>(false)\n\n  const onMessage = useCallback(\n    (event: MessageEvent) => {\n      if (isDocumentEvent(event, serverURL)) {\n        if (typeof refresh === 'function') {\n          refresh()\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    [refresh, serverURL],\n  )\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n      window.addEventListener('message', onMessage)\n    }\n\n    if (!hasSentReadyMessage.current) {\n      hasSentReadyMessage.current = true\n\n      ready({\n        serverURL,\n      })\n    }\n\n    return () => {\n      if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n        window.removeEventListener('message', onMessage)\n      }\n    }\n  }, [serverURL, onMessage, depth, apiRoute])\n\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n## Example\n\nFor a working demonstration of this, check out the official [Live Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload). There you will find a fully working example of how to implement Live Preview in your Next.js App Router application.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Updates do not appear as fast as client-side Live Preview\n\nIf you are noticing that updates feel less snappy than client-side Live Preview (i.e. the `useLivePreview` hook), this is because of how the two differ in how they work—instead of emitting events against _form state_, server-side Live Preview refreshes the route after a new document is _saved_.\n\nUse [Autosave](../versions/autosave) to mimic this effect server-side. Try decreasing the value of `versions.autoSave.interval` to make the experience feel more responsive:\n\n```ts\n// collection.ts\n{\n   versions: {\n    drafts: {\n      autosave: {\n        interval: 375,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Iframe refuses to connect\n\nIf your front-end application has set a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) that blocks the Admin Panel from loading your front-end application, the iframe will not be able to load your site. To resolve this, you can whitelist the Admin Panel's domain in your CSP by setting the `frame-ancestors` directive:\n\n```plaintext\nframe-ancestors: \"self\" localhost:* https://your-site.com;\n```\n",

        "content": "\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  If your front-end application supports Server Components like the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), etc., we suggest setting up [server-side Live Preview](./server) instead.\n</Banner>\n\nWhile using Live Preview, the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) emits a new `window.postMessage` event every time your document has changed. Your front-end application can listen for these events and re-render accordingly.\n\nIf your front-end application is built with [React](#react) or [Vue](#vue), use the `useLivePreview` hooks that Payload provides. In the future, all other major frameworks like Svelte will be officially supported. If you are using any of these frameworks today, you can still integrate with Live Preview yourself using the underlying tooling that Payload provides. See [building your own hook](#building-your-own-hook) for more information.\n\nBy default, all hooks accept the following args:\n\n| Path               | Description                                                                            |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`serverURL`** \\* | The URL of your Payload server.                                                        |\n| **`initialData`**  | The initial data of the document. The live data will be merged in as changes are made. |\n| **`depth`**        | The depth of the relationships to fetch. Defaults to `0`.                              |\n| **`apiRoute`**     | The path of your API route as defined in `routes.api`. Defaults to `/api`.             |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\nAnd return the following values:\n\n| Path            | Description                                                      |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`data`**      | The live data of the document, merged with the initial data.     |\n| **`isLoading`** | A boolean that indicates whether or not the document is loading. |\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  If your front-end is tightly coupled to required fields, you should ensure that your UI does not\n  break when these fields are removed. For example, if you are rendering something like\n  `data.relatedPosts[0].title`, your page will break once you remove the first related post. To get\n  around this, use conditional logic, optional chaining, or default values in your UI where needed.\n  For example, `data?.relatedPosts?.[0]?.title`.\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  It is important that the `depth` argument matches exactly with the depth of your initial page request. The depth property is used to populated relationships and uploads beyond their IDs. See [Depth](../getting-started/concepts#depth) for more information.\n</Banner>\n\n## Frameworks\n\nLive Preview will work with any front-end framework that supports the native [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API. By default, Payload officially supports the most popular frameworks, including:\n\n- [React](#react)\n- [Vue](#vue)\n\nIf your framework is not listed, you can still integrate with Live Preview using the underlying tooling that Payload provides. [More details](#building-your-own-hook).\n\n### React\n\nIf your front-end application is built with client-side [React](https://react.dev) like [Next.js Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages), you can use the `useLivePreview` hook that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the `@payloadcms/live-preview-react` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview-react\n```\n\nThen, use the `useLivePreview` hook in your React component:\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useLivePreview } from '@payloadcms/live-preview-react'\nimport { Page as PageType } from '@/payload-types'\n\n// Fetch the page in a server component, pass it to the client component, then thread it through the hook\n// The hook will take over from there and keep the preview in sync with the changes you make\n// The `data` property will contain the live data of the document\nexport const PageClient: React.FC<{\n  page: {\n    title: string\n  }\n}> = ({ page: initialPage }) => {\n  const { data } = useLivePreview<PageType>({\n    initialData: initialPage,\n    serverURL: PAYLOAD_SERVER_URL,\n    depth: 2,\n  })\n\n  return <h1>{data.title}</h1>\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong>\n  If you are using [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), we strongly suggest setting up [server-side Live Preview](./server) instead.\n</Banner>\n\n### Vue\n\nIf your front-end application is built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) or [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.js), you can use the `useLivePreview` composable that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the `@payloadcms/live-preview-vue` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview-vue\n```\n\nThen, use the `useLivePreview` hook in your Vue component:\n\n```ts\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport type { PageData } from '~/types';\nimport { defineProps } from 'vue';\nimport { useLivePreview } from '@payloadcms/live-preview-vue';\n\n// Fetch the initial data on the parent component or using async state\nconst props = defineProps<{ initialData: PageData }>();\n\n// The hook will take over from here and keep the preview in sync with the changes you make.\n// The `data` property will contain the live data of the document only when viewed from the Preview view of the Admin UI.\nconst { data } = useLivePreview<PageData>({\n  initialData: props.initialData,\n  serverURL: \"<PAYLOAD_SERVER_URL>\",\n  depth: 2,\n});\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <h1>{{ data.title }}</h1>\n</template>\n```\n\n## Building your own hook\n\nNo matter what front-end framework you are using, you can build your own hook using the same underlying tooling that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the base `@payloadcms/live-preview` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview\n```\n\nThis package provides the following functions:\n\n| Path                     | Description                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`subscribe`**          | Subscribes to the Admin Panel's `window.postMessage` events and calls the provided callback function.                      |\n| **`unsubscribe`**        | Unsubscribes from the Admin Panel's `window.postMessage` events.                                                           |\n| **`ready`**              | Sends a `window.postMessage` event to the Admin Panel to indicate that the front-end is ready to receive messages.         |\n| **`isLivePreviewEvent`** | Checks if a `MessageEvent` originates from the Admin Panel and is a Live Preview event, i.e. debounced form state.         |\n\nThe `subscribe` function takes the following args:\n\n| Path               | Description                                                                                 |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`callback`** \\*  | A callback function that is called with `data` every time a change is made to the document. |\n| **`serverURL`** \\* | The URL of your Payload server.                                                             |\n| **`initialData`**  | The initial data of the document. The live data will be merged in as changes are made.      |\n| **`depth`**        | The depth of the relationships to fetch. Defaults to `0`.                                   |\n\nWith these functions, you can build your own hook using your front-end framework of choice:\n\n```tsx\nimport { subscribe, unsubscribe } from '@payloadcms/live-preview'\n\n// To build your own hook, subscribe to Live Preview events using the `subscribe` function\n// It handles everything from:\n// 1. Listening to `window.postMessage` events\n// 2. Merging initial data with active form state\n// 3. Populating relationships and uploads\n// 4. Calling the `onChange` callback with the result\n// Your hook should also:\n// 1. Tell the Admin Panel when it is ready to receive messages\n// 2. Handle the results of the `onChange` callback to update the UI\n// 3. Unsubscribe from the `window.postMessage` events when it unmounts\n```\n\nHere is an example of what the same `useLivePreview` React hook from above looks like under the hood:\n\n```tsx\nimport { subscribe, unsubscribe, ready } from '@payloadcms/live-preview'\nimport { useCallback, useEffect, useState, useRef } from 'react'\n\nexport const useLivePreview = <T extends any>(props: {\n  depth?: number\n  initialData: T\n  serverURL: string\n}): {\n  data: T\n  isLoading: boolean\n} => {\n  const { depth = 0, initialData, serverURL } = props\n  const [data, setData] = useState<T>(initialData)\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(true)\n  const hasSentReadyMessage = useRef<boolean>(false)\n\n  const onChange = useCallback((mergedData) => {\n    // When a change is made, the `onChange` callback will be called with the merged data\n    // Set this merged data into state so that React will re-render the UI\n    setData(mergedData)\n    setIsLoading(false)\n  }, [])\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Listen for `window.postMessage` events from the Admin Panel\n    // When a change is made, the `onChange` callback will be called with the merged data\n    const subscription = subscribe({\n      callback: onChange,\n      depth,\n      initialData,\n      serverURL,\n    })\n\n    // Once subscribed, send a `ready` message back up to the Admin Panel\n    // This will indicate that the front-end is ready to receive messages\n    if (!hasSentReadyMessage.current) {\n      hasSentReadyMessage.current = true\n\n      ready({\n        serverURL,\n      })\n    }\n\n    // When the component unmounts, unsubscribe from the `window.postMessage` events\n    return () => {\n      unsubscribe(subscription)\n    }\n  }, [serverURL, onChange, depth, initialData])\n\n  return {\n    data,\n    isLoading,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  When building your own hook, ensure that the args and return values are consistent with the ones\n  listed at the top of this document. This will ensure that all hooks follow the same API.\n</Banner>\n\n## Example\n\nFor a working demonstration of this, check out the official [Live Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload). There you will find examples of various front-end frameworks and how to integrate each one of them, including:\n\n- [Next.js App Router](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/next-app)\n- [Next.js Pages Router](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/next-pages)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Relationships and/or uploads are not populating\n\nIf you are using relationships or uploads in your front-end application, and your front-end application runs on a different domain than your Payload server, you may need to configure [CORS](../configuration/overview) to allow requests to be made between the two domains. This includes sites that are running on a different port or subdomain. Similarly, if you are protecting resources behind user authentication, you may also need to configure [CSRF](../authentication/overview#csrf-protection) to allow cookies to be sent between the two domains. For example:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  // If your site is running on a different domain than your Payload server,\n  // This will allows requests to be made between the two domains\n  cors: {\n    [\n      'http://localhost:3001' // Your front-end application\n    ],\n  },\n  // If you are protecting resources behind user authentication,\n  // This will allow cookies to be sent between the two domains\n  csrf: {\n    [\n      'http://localhost:3001' // Your front-end application\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Relationships and/or uploads disappear after editing a document\n\nIt is possible that either you are setting an improper [`depth`](../getting-started/concepts#depth) in your initial request and/or your `useLivePreview` hook, or they're mismatched. Ensure that the `depth` parameter is set to the correct value, and that it matches exactly in both places. For example:\n\n```tsx\n// Your initial request\nconst { docs } = await payload.find({\n  collection: 'pages',\n  depth: 1, // Ensure this is set to the proper depth for your application\n  where: {\n    slug: {\n      equals: 'home',\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```tsx\n// Your hook\nconst { data } = useLivePreview<PageType>({\n  initialData: initialPage,\n  serverURL: PAYLOAD_SERVER_URL,\n  depth: 1, // Ensure this matches the depth of your initial request\n})\n```\n\n### Iframe refuses to connect\n\nIf your front-end application has set a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) that blocks the Admin Panel from loading your front-end application, the iframe will not be able to load your site. To resolve this, you can whitelist the Admin Panel's domain in your CSP by setting the `frame-ancestors` directive:\n\n```plaintext\nframe-ancestors: \"self\" localhost:* https://your-site.com;\n```\n",

Declaring who should have access to what documents is no more complex than writing a simple JavaScript function that either returns a `boolean` or a [`query`](../queries/overview) constraint to restrict which documents users can interact with.\n\n<YouTube id=\"DoPLyXG26Dg\" title=\"Overview of Payload Access Control\" />\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n- Allowing anyone `read` access to all `Post`s\n- Only allowing public access to `Post`s where a `status` field is equal to `published`\n- Giving only `User`s with a `role` field equal to `admin` the ability to delete `Page`(s)\n- Allowing anyone to create `ContactSubmission`s, but only logged in users to `read`, `update` or `delete` them\n- Restricting a `User` to only be able to see their own `Order`(s), but no others\n- Allowing `User`s that belong to a certain `Organization` to access only that `Organization`'s `Resource`s\n\n## Default Settings\n\n**By default, all Collections and Globals require that a user is logged in to be able to interact in any way.** The default Access Control function evaluates the `user` from the `req` and returns `true` if a user is logged in, and `false` if not.\n\n**Default Access function:**\n\n```ts\nconst defaultPayloadAccess = ({ req: { user } }) => {\n  // Return `true` if a user is found\n  // and `false` if it is undefined or null\n  return Boolean(user)\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  In the Local API, all Access Control functions are skipped by default, allowing your server to do\n  whatever it needs. But, you can opt back in by setting the option\n  <strong>\n    overrideAccess\n  </strong>\n  {' '}\n  to <strong>false</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\n## Access Control Types\n\nYou can manage access within Payload on three different levels:\n\n- [Collections](../access-control/collections)\n- [Fields](../access-control/fields)\n- [Globals](../access-control/globals)\n\n## When Access Control is Executed\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Access control functions are utilized in two places. It's important to understand how and when\n  your access control is executed.\n</Banner>\n\n### As you execute operations\n\nWhen you perform Payload operations like `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`, your access control functions will be executed before any changes or operations are completed.\n\n### Within the Admin UI\n\nThe Payload Admin UI responds dynamically to the access control that you define. For example, if you restrict editing a `ExampleCollection` to only users that feature a `role` of `admin`, the Payload Admin UI will **hide** the `ExampleCollection` from the Admin UI entirely. This is super powerful and allows you to control who can do what with your Admin UI.\n\nTo accomplish this, Payload ships with an `Access` operation, which is executed when a user logs into the Admin UI. Payload will execute each one of your access control functions, across all collections, globals, and fields, at the top level and return a response that contains a reflection of what the currently authenticated user can do with your application.\n\n## Argument Availability\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When your access control functions are executed via the <strong>access</strong> operation, the{' '}\n  <strong>id</strong> and <strong>data</strong> arguments will be <strong>undefined</strong>,\n  because Payload is executing your functions without referencing a specific document.\n</Banner>\n\nIf you use `id` or `data` within your access control functions, make sure to check that they are defined first. If they are not, then you can assume that your access control is being executed via the `access` operation, to determine solely what the user can do within the Admin UI.\n",

If the Hook should modify data before a document is updated or created, and it relies on asynchronous actions such as fetching data from a third party, it might make sense to define your Hook as an asynchronous function, so you can be sure that your Hook completes before the operation's lifecycle continues. Async hooks are run in series - so if you have two async hooks defined, the second hook will wait for the first to complete before it starts.\n\nIf your Hook simply performs a side-effect, such as updating a CRM, it might be okay to define it synchronously, so the Payload operation does not have to wait for your hook to complete.\n\n## Server-only execution\n\nPayload Hooks are only triggered on the server and are automatically excluded from the Payload Admin bundle.\n\n## Hook Types\n\nYou can specify hooks in the following contexts:\n\n- [Collection Hooks](../hooks/collections)\n- [Field Hooks](../hooks/fields)\n- [Global Hooks](../hooks/globals)\n",

Each Hook type receives specific arguments and has the ability to modify specific outputs.\n\n`collections/exampleHooks.js`\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload';\n\nexport const ExampleHooks: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-hooks',\n  fields: [\n    { name: 'name', type: 'text'},\n  ],\n  hooks: {\n    beforeOperation: [(args) => {...}],\n    beforeValidate: [(args) => {...}],\n    beforeDelete: [(args) => {...}],\n    beforeChange: [(args) => {...}],\n    beforeRead: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterChange: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterRead: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterDelete: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterOperation: [(args) => {...}],\n\n    // Auth-enabled hooks\n    beforeLogin: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterLogin: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterLogout: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterRefresh: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterMe: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterForgotPassword: [(args) => {...}],\n    refresh: [(args) => {...}],\n    me: [(args) => {...}],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### beforeOperation\n\nThe `beforeOperation` hook can be used to modify the arguments that operations accept or execute side-effects that run before an operation begins.\n\nAvailable Collection operations include `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `login`, `refresh`, and `forgotPassword`.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionBeforeOperationHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst beforeOperationHook: CollectionBeforeOperationHook = async ({\n  args, // original arguments passed into the operation\n  operation, // name of the operation\n  req, // full Request object\n}) => {\n  return args // return modified operation arguments as necessary\n}\n```\n\n### beforeValidate\n\nRuns before the `create` and `update` operations. This hook allows you to add or format data before the incoming data is validated server-side.\n\nPlease do note that this does not run before the client-side validation. If you added a `validate` function, this would be the lifecycle:\n\n1. `validate` runs on the client\n2. if successful, `beforeValidate` runs on the server\n3. `validate` runs on the server\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionBeforeValidateHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst beforeValidateHook: CollectionBeforeValidateHook = async ({\n  data, // incoming data to update or create with\n  req, // full Request object\n  operation, // name of the operation ie. 'create', 'update'\n  originalDoc, // original document\n}) => {\n  return data // Return data to either create or update a document with\n}\n```\n\n### beforeChange\n\nImmediately following validation, `beforeChange` hooks will run within `create` and `update` operations. At this stage, you can be confident that the data that will be saved to the document is valid in accordance to your field validations. You can optionally modify the shape of data to be saved.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionBeforeChangeHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst beforeChangeHook: CollectionBeforeChangeHook = async ({\n  data, // incoming data to update or create with\n  req, // full Request object\n  operation, // name of the operation ie. 'create', 'update'\n  originalDoc, // original document\n}) => {\n  return data // Return data to either create or update a document with\n}\n```\n\n### afterChange\n\nAfter a document is created or updated, the `afterChange` hook runs. This hook is helpful to recalculate statistics such as total sales within a global, syncing user profile changes to a CRM, and more.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterChangeHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst afterChangeHook: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({\n  doc, // full document data\n  req, // full Request object\n  previousDoc, // document data before updating the collection\n  operation, // name of the operation ie. 'create', 'update'\n}) => {\n  return doc\n}\n```\n\n### beforeRead\n\nRuns before `find` and `findByID` operations are transformed for output by `afterRead`. This hook fires before hidden fields are removed and before localized fields are flattened into the requested locale. Using this Hook will provide you with all locales and all hidden fields via the `doc` argument.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionBeforeReadHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst beforeReadHook: CollectionBeforeReadHook = async ({\n  doc, // full document data\n  req, // full Request object\n  query, // JSON formatted query\n}) => {\n  return doc\n}\n```\n\n### afterRead\n\nRuns as the last step before documents are returned. Flattens locales, hides protected fields, and removes fields that users do not have access to.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterReadHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst afterReadHook: CollectionAfterReadHook = async ({\n  doc, // full document data\n  req, // full Request object\n  query, // JSON formatted query\n  findMany, // boolean to denote if this hook is running against finding one, or finding many\n}) => {\n  return doc\n}\n```\n\n### beforeDelete\n\nRuns before the `delete` operation. Returned values are discarded.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionBeforeDeleteHook } from 'payload';\n\nconst beforeDeleteHook: CollectionBeforeDeleteHook = async ({\n  req, // full Request object\n  id, // id of document to delete\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterDelete\n\nRuns immediately after the `delete` operation removes records from the database. Returned values are discarded.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterDeleteHook } from 'payload';\n\nconst afterDeleteHook: CollectionAfterDeleteHook = async ({\n  req, // full Request object\n  id, // id of document to delete\n  doc, // deleted document\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterOperation\n\nThe `afterOperation` hook can be used to modify the result of operations or execute side-effects that run after an operation has completed.\n\nAvailable Collection operations include `create`, `find`, `findByID`, `update`, `updateByID`, `delete`, `deleteByID`, `login`, `refresh`, and `forgotPassword`.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterOperationHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst afterOperationHook: CollectionAfterOperationHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the operation\n  operation, // name of the operation\n  req, // full Request object\n  result, // the result of the operation, before modifications\n}) => {\n  return result // return modified result as necessary\n}\n```\n\n### beforeLogin\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs during `login` operations where a user with the provided credentials exist, but before a token is generated and added to the response. You can optionally modify the user that is returned, or throw an error in order to deny the login operation.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionBeforeLoginHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst beforeLoginHook: CollectionBeforeLoginHook = async ({\n  req, // full Request object\n  user, // user being logged in\n}) => {\n  return user\n}\n```\n\n### afterLogin\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after successful `login` operations. You can optionally modify the user that is returned.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterLoginHook } from 'payload';\n\nconst afterLoginHook: CollectionAfterLoginHook = async ({\n  req, // full Request object\n  user, // user that was logged in\n  token, // user token\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterLogout\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after `logout` operations.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterLogoutHook } from 'payload';\n\nconst afterLogoutHook: CollectionAfterLogoutHook = async ({\n  req, // full Request object\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterRefresh\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after `refresh` operations.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterRefreshHook } from 'payload';\n\nconst afterRefreshHook: CollectionAfterRefreshHook = async ({\n  req, // full Request object\n  res, // full Response object\n  token, // newly refreshed user token\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterMe\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after `me` operations.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterMeHook } from 'payload';\n\nconst afterMeHook: CollectionAfterMeHook = async ({\n  req, // full Request object\n  response, // response to return\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterForgotPassword\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after successful `forgotPassword` operations. Returned values are discarded.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionAfterForgotPasswordHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst afterForgotPasswordHook: CollectionAfterForgotPasswordHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the operation\n  context,\n  collection, // The collection which this hook is being run on\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### refresh\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook allows you to optionally replace the default behavior of the `refresh` operation with your own. If you optionally return a value from your hook, the operation will not perform its own logic and continue.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionRefreshHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst myRefreshHook: CollectionRefreshHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the `refresh` operation\n  user, // the user as queried from the database \n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### me\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook allows you to optionally replace the default behavior of the `me` operation with your own. If you optionally return a value from your hook, the operation will not perform its own logic and continue.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionMeHook } from 'payload'\n\nconst meHook: CollectionMeHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the `me` operation\n  user, // the user as queried from the database \n}) => {...}\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nPayload exports a type for each Collection hook which can be accessed as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type {\n  CollectionBeforeOperationHook,\n  CollectionBeforeValidateHook,\n  CollectionBeforeChangeHook,\n  CollectionAfterChangeHook,\n  CollectionAfterReadHook,\n  CollectionBeforeReadHook,\n  CollectionBeforeDeleteHook,\n  CollectionAfterDeleteHook,\n  CollectionBeforeLoginHook,\n  CollectionAfterLoginHook,\n  CollectionAfterLogoutHook,\n  CollectionAfterRefreshHook,\n  CollectionAfterMeHook,\n  CollectionAfterForgotPasswordHook,\n  CollectionRefreshHook,\n  CollectionMeHook,\n} from 'payload'\n```\n",

Field Hooks may\noptionally return the value that should be used within the field.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important</strong>\n  <br />\n  Due to GraphQL's typed nature, you should never change the type of data that you return from a\n  field, otherwise GraphQL will produce errors. If you need to change the shape or type of data,\n  reconsider Field Hooks and instead evaluate if Collection / Global hooks might suit you better.\n</Banner>\n\n## Examples of Field Hooks\n\nTo better illustrate how field-level hooks can be applied, here are some specific examples. These demonstrate the\nflexibility and potential of field hooks in different contexts. Remember, these examples are just a starting point - the\ntrue potential of field-level hooks lies in their adaptability to a wide array of use cases.\n\n### beforeValidate\n\nRuns before the `update` operation. This hook allows you to pre-process or format field data before it undergoes\nvalidation.\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nconst usernameField: Field = {\n  name: 'username',\n  type: 'text',\n  hooks: {\n    beforeValidate: [\n      ({ value }) => {\n        // Trim whitespace and convert to lowercase\n        return value.trim().toLowerCase()\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `beforeValidate` hook is used to process the `username` field. The hook takes the incoming value of\nthe field and transforms it by trimming whitespace and converting it to lowercase. This ensures that the username is\nstored in a consistent format in the database.\n\n### beforeChange\n\nImmediately following validation, `beforeChange` hooks will run within `create` and `update` operations. At this stage,\nyou can be confident that the field data that will be saved to the document is valid in accordance to your field\nvalidations.\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nconst emailField: Field = {\n  name: 'email',\n  type: 'email',\n  hooks: {\n    beforeChange: [\n      ({ value, operation }) => {\n        if (operation === 'create') {\n          // Perform additional validation or transformation for 'create' operation\n        }\n        return value\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn the `emailField`, the `beforeChange` hook checks the `operation` type. If the operation is `create`, it performs\nadditional validation or transformation on the email field value. This allows for operation-specific logic to be applied\nto the field.\n\n### afterChange\n\nThe `afterChange` hook is executed after a field's value has been changed and saved in the database. This hook is useful\nfor post-processing or triggering side effects based on the new value of the field.\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nconst membershipStatusField: Field = {\n  name: 'membershipStatus',\n  type: 'select',\n  options: [\n    { label: 'Standard', value: 'standard' },\n    { label: 'Premium', value: 'premium' },\n    { label: 'VIP', value: 'vip' },\n  ],\n  hooks: {\n    afterChange: [\n      ({ value, previousValue, req }) => {\n        if (value !== previousValue) {\n          // Log or perform an action when the membership status changes\n          console.log(\n            `User ID ${req.user.id} changed their membership status from ${previousValue} to ${value}.`,\n          )\n          // Here, you can implement actions that could track conversions from one tier to another\n        }\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `afterChange` hook is used with a `membershipStatusField`, which allows users to select their\nmembership level (Standard, Premium, VIP). The hook monitors changes in the membership status. When a change occurs, it\nlogs the update and can be used to trigger further actions, such as tracking conversion from one tier to another or\nnotifying them about changes in their membership benefits.\n\n### afterRead\n\nThe `afterRead` hook is invoked after a field value is read from the database. This is ideal for formatting or\ntransforming the field data for output.\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nconst dateField: Field = {\n  name: 'createdAt',\n  type: 'date',\n  hooks: {\n    afterRead: [\n      ({ value }) => {\n        // Format date for display\n        return new Date(value).toLocaleDateString()\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `afterRead` hook for the `dateField` is used to format the date into a more readable format\nusing `toLocaleDateString()`. This hook modifies the way the date is presented to the user, making it more\nuser-friendly.\n\n### beforeDuplicate\n\nThe `beforeDuplicate` field hook is called on each locale (when using localization), when duplicating a document. It may be used when documents having the\nexact same properties may cause issue. This gives you a way to avoid duplicate names on `unique`, `required` fields or when external systems expect non-repeating values on documents.\n\nThis hook gets called after `beforeChange` hooks are called and before the document is saved to the database.\n\nBy Default, unique and required text fields Payload will append \"- Copy\" to the original document value. The default is not added if your field has its own, you must return non-unique values from your beforeDuplicate hook to avoid errors or enable the `disableDuplicate` option on the collection.\nHere is an example of a number field with a hook that increments the number to avoid unique constraint errors when duplicating a document:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload'\n\nconst numberField: Field = {\n  name: 'number',\n  type: 'number',\n  hooks: {\n    // increment existing value by 1\n    beforeDuplicate: [({ value }) => {\n      return (value ?? 0) + 1\n    }],\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nPayload exports a type for field hooks which can be accessed and used as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type { FieldHook } from 'payload'\n\n// Field hook type is a generic that takes three arguments:\n// 1: The document type\n// 2: The value type\n// 3: The sibling data type\n\ntype ExampleFieldHook = FieldHook<ExampleDocumentType, string, SiblingDataType>\n\nconst exampleFieldHook: ExampleFieldHook = (args) => {\n  const {\n    value, // Typed as `string` as shown above\n    data, // Typed as a Partial of your ExampleDocumentType\n    siblingData, // Typed as a Partial of SiblingDataType\n    originalDoc, // Typed as ExampleDocumentType\n    operation,\n    req,\n  } = args\n\n  // Do something here...\n\n  return value // should return a string as typed above, undefined, or null\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "\nThe `context` object in hooks is used to share data across different hooks. The persists throughout the entire lifecycle of a request and is available within every hook. This allows you to add logic to your hooks based on the request state by setting properties to `req.context` and using them elsewhere.\n\n## When to use Context\n\nContext gives you a way forward on otherwise difficult problems such as:\n\n1. **Passing data between hooks**: Needing data in multiple hooks from a 3rd party API, it could be retrieved and used in `beforeChange` and later used again in an `afterChange` hook without having to fetch it twice.\n2. **Preventing infinite loops**: Calling `payload.update()` on the same document that triggered an `afterChange` hook will create an infinite loop, control the flow by assigning a no-op condition to context\n3. **Passing data to local API**: Setting values on the `req.context` and pass it to `payload.create()` you can provide additional data to hooks without adding extraneous fields.\n4. **Passing data between hooks and middleware or custom endpoints**: Hooks could set context across multiple collections and then be used in a final `postMiddleware`.\n\n## How to Use Context\n\nLet's see examples on how context can be used in the first two scenarios mentioned above:\n\n### Passing data between hooks\n\nTo pass data between hooks, you can assign values to context in an earlier hook in the lifecycle of a request and expect it the context in a later hook.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nconst Customer: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  hooks: {\n    beforeChange: [\n      async ({ context, data }) => {\n        // assign the customerData to context for use later\n        context.customerData = await fetchCustomerData(data.customerID)\n        return {\n          ...data,\n          // some data we use here\n          name: context.customerData.name,\n        }\n      },\n    ],\n    afterChange: [\n      async ({ context, doc, req }) => {\n        // use context.customerData without needing to fetch it again\n        if (context.customerData.contacted === false) {\n          createTodo('Call Customer', context.customerData)\n        }\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Preventing infinite loops\n\nLet's say you have an `afterChange` hook, and you want to do a calculation inside the hook (as the document ID needed for the calculation is available in the `afterChange` hook, but not in the `beforeChange` hook). Once that's done, you want to update the document with the result of the calculation.\n\nBad example:\n\n```ts\nconst Customer: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  hooks: {\n    afterChange: [\n      async ({ doc }) => {\n        await payload.update({\n          // DANGER: updating the same slug as the collection in an afterChange will create an infinite loop!\n          collection: 'customers',\n          id: doc.id,\n          data: {\n            ...(await fetchCustomerData(data.customerID)),\n          },\n        })\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nInstead of the above, we need to tell the `afterChange` hook to not run again if it performs the update (and thus not update itself again). We can solve that with context.\n\nFixed example:\n\n```ts\nconst MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'slug',\n  hooks: {\n    afterChange: [\n      async ({ context, doc }) => {\n        // return if flag was previously set\n        if (context.triggerAfterChange === false) {\n          return\n        }\n        await payload.update({\n          collection: contextHooksSlug,\n          id: doc.id,\n          data: {\n            ...(await fetchCustomerData(data.customerID)),\n          },\n          context: {\n            // set a flag to prevent from running again\n            triggerAfterChange: false,\n          },\n        })\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Typing context\n\nThe default typescript interface for `context` is `{ [key: string]: unknown }`. If you prefer a more strict typing in your project or when authoring plugins for others, you can override this using the `declare` syntax.\n\nThis is known as \"type augmentation\" - a TypeScript feature which allows us to add types to existing objects. Simply put this in any .ts or .d.ts file:\n\n```ts\nimport { RequestContext as OriginalRequestContext } from 'payload'\n\ndeclare module 'payload' {\n  // Create a new interface that merges your additional fields with the original one\n  export interface RequestContext extends OriginalRequestContext {\n    myObject?: string\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will add a the property `myObject` with a type of string to every context object. Make sure to follow this example correctly, as type augmentation can mess up your types if you do it wrong.\n",

But, you can add support to one or many Collections of your own. For more information on how to customize, override, or remove the default `User` collection, [click here](../admin/overview#the-admin-user-collection).\n\n## Enabling Auth on a collection\n\nEvery Payload Collection can opt-in to supporting Authentication by specifying the `auth` property on the Collection's config to either `true` or to an object containing `auth` options.\n\n**For a full list of all `auth` options, [click here](../authentication/config).**\n\nSimple example collection:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Admins: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'admins',\n  // highlight-start\n  auth: {\n    tokenExpiration: 7200, // How many seconds to keep the user logged in\n    verify: true, // Require email verification before being allowed to authenticate\n    maxLoginAttempts: 5, // Automatically lock a user out after X amount of failed logins\n    lockTime: 600 * 1000, // Time period to allow the max login attempts\n    // More options are available\n  },\n  // highlight-end\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'role',\n      type: 'select',\n      required: true,\n      options: ['user', 'admin', 'editor', 'developer'],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**By enabling Authentication on a config, the following modifications will automatically be made to your Collection:**\n\n1. `email` as well as password `salt` & `hash` fields will be added to your Collection's schema\n1. The Admin panel will feature a new set of corresponding UI to allow for changing password and editing email\n1. [A new set of `operations`](../authentication/operations) will be exposed via Payload's REST, Local, and GraphQL APIs\n\nOnce enabled, each document that is created within the Collection can be thought of as a `user` - who can make use of commonly required authentication functions such as logging in / out, resetting their password, and more.\n\n## Authentication Strategies\n\nOut of the box Payload ships with a few powerful authentication strategies. HTTP-Only Cookies, JWT's and API-Keys, they can work together or individually. You can also have multiple collections that have auth enabled, but only 1 of them can be used to log into the admin panel.\n\n### HTTP-Only Cookies\n\nHTTP-only cookies are a highly secure method of storing identifiable data on a user's device so that Payload can automatically recognize a returning user until their cookie expires. They are totally protected from common XSS attacks and <strong>cannot be read by JavaScript in the browser</strong>, unlike JWT's.\n\nYou can learn more about this strategy from the [HTTP-Only Cookies](../authentication/http-only-cookies) docs.\n\n### JSON Web Tokens\n\nJWT (JSON Web Tokens) can also be utilized to perform authentication. Tokens are generated on `login`, `refresh` and `me` operations and can be attached to future requests to authenticate users.\n\nYou can learn more about this strategy from the [JWT](../authentication/jwt) docs.\n\n### API Keys\n\nAPI Keys can be enabled on auth collections. These are particularly useful when you want to authenticate against Payload from a third party service.\n\nYou can learn more about this strategy from the [API Keys](../authentication/api-keys) docs.\n\n### Custom Strategies\n\nThere are cases where these may not be enough for your application. Payload is extendable by design so you can wire up your own strategy when you need to.\n\nYou can learn more about custom strategies from the [Custom Strategies](../authentication/custom-strategies) docs.\n\n## Logging in / out, resetting password, etc.\n\n[Click here](../authentication/operations) for a list of all automatically-enabled Auth operations, including `login`, `logout`, `refresh`, and others.\n",

The function should return a string that supports HTML, which can be a full HTML email.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  HTML templating can be used to create custom email templates, inline CSS automatically, and more.\n  You can make a reusable function that standardizes all email sent from Payload, which makes\n  sending custom emails more DRY. Payload doesn't ship with an HTML templating engine, so you are\n  free to choose your own.\n</Banner>\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Customers: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    forgotPassword: {\n      // highlight-start\n      generateEmailHTML: ({ req, token, user }) => {\n        // Use the token provided to allow your user to reset their password\n        const resetPasswordURL = `https://yourfrontend.com/reset-password?token=${token}`\n\n        return `\n          <!doctype html>\n          <html>\n            <body>\n              <h1>Here is my custom email template!</h1>\n              <p>Hello, ${user.email}!</p>\n              <p>Click below to reset your password.</p>\n              <p>\n                <a href=\"${resetPasswordURL}\">${resetPasswordURL}</a>\n              </p>\n            </body>\n          </html>\n        `\n      },\n      // highlight-end\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you specify a different URL to send your users to for resetting their password, such as a page\n  on the frontend of your app or similar, you need to handle making the call to the Payload REST or\n  GraphQL reset-password operation yourself on your frontend, using the token that was provided for\n  you. Above, it was passed via query parameter.\n</Banner>\n\n**`generateEmailSubject`**\n\nSimilarly to the above `generateEmailHTML`, you can also customize the subject of the email. The function argument are the same but you can only return a string - not HTML.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    forgotPassword: {\n      // highlight-start\n      generateEmailSubject: ({ req, user }) => {\n        return `Hey ${user.email}, reset your password!`;\n      }\n      // highlight-end\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Email Verification\n\nIf you'd like to require email verification before a user can successfully log in, you can enable it by passing `true` or an `options` object to `auth.verify`. The following options are available:\n\n**`generateEmailHTML`**\n\nFunction that accepts one argument, containing `{ req, token, user }`, that allows for overriding the HTML within emails that are sent to users indicating how to validate their account. The function should return a string that supports HTML, which can optionally be a full HTML email.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Customers: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    verify: {\n      // highlight-start\n      generateEmailHTML: ({ req, token, user }) => {\n        // Use the token provided to allow your user to verify their account\n        const url = `https://yourfrontend.com/verify?token=${token}`\n\n        return `Hey ${user.email}, verify your email by clicking here: ${url}`\n      },\n      // highlight-end\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you specify a different URL to send your users to for email verification, such as a page on the\n  frontend of your app or similar, you need to handle making the call to the Payload REST or GraphQL\n  verification operation yourself on your frontend, using the token that was provided for you.\n  Above, it was passed via query parameter.\n</Banner>\n\n**`generateEmailSubject`**\n\nSimilarly to the above `generateEmailHTML`, you can also customize the subject of the email.

The Developer tools\n  will still show HTTP-only cookies.\n</Banner>\n\n### CSRF Attacks\n\nCSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks are common and dangerous. By using an HTTP-only cookie, Payload removes many XSS vulnerabilities, however, CSRF attacks can still be possible.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a popular app `https://payload-finances.com` that allows users to manage finances, send and receive money. As Payload is using HTTP-only cookies, that means that browsers automatically will include cookies when sending requests to your domain - <strong>no matter what page created the request</strong>.\n\nSo, if a user of `https://payload-finances.com` is logged in and is browsing around on the internet, they might stumble onto a page with malicious intent. Let's look at an example:\n\n```ts\n// malicious-intent.com\n// makes an authenticated request as on your behalf\n\nconst maliciousRequest = await fetch(`https://payload-finances.com/api/me`, {\n  credentials: 'include'\n}).then(res => await res.json())\n```\n\nIn this scenario, if your cookie was still valid, malicious-intent.com would be able to make requests like the one above on your behalf. This is a CSRF attack.\n\n### CSRF Prevention\n\nDefine domains that your trust and are willing to accept Payload HTTP-only cookie based requests from. Use the `csrf` option on the base Payload config to do this:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  serverURL: 'https://my-payload-instance.com',\n  // highlight-start\n  csrf: [\n    // whitelist of domains to allow cookie auth from\n    'https://your-frontend-app.com',\n    'https://your-other-frontend-app.com',\n    // `config.serverURL` is added by default if defined\n  ],\n  // highlight-end\n  collections: [\n    // collections here\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n",

You can do that by setting `removeTokenFromResponse` to `true` like so:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const UsersWithoutJWTs: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'users-without-jwts',\n  auth: {\n    removeTokenFromRepsonse: true, // highlight-line\n  },\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "\nTo integrate with third-party APIs or services, you might need the ability to generate API keys that can be used to identify as a certain user within Payload. API keys are generated on a user-by-user basis, similar to email and passwords, and are meant to represent a single user.\n\nFor example, if you have a third-party service or external app that needs to be able to perform protected actions against Payload, first you need to create a user within Payload, i.e. `dev@thirdparty.com`. From your external application you will need to authenticate with that user, you have two options:\n\n1. Log in each time with that user and receive an expiring token to request with.\n1. Generate a non-expiring API key for that user to request with.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br/>\n  This is particularly useful as you can create a \"user\" that reflects an integration with a specific external service and assign a \"role\" or specific access only needed by that service/integration.\n</Banner>\n\nTechnically, both of these options will work for third-party integrations but the second option with API key is simpler, because it reduces the amount of work that your integrations need to do to be authenticated properly.\n\nTo enable API keys on a collection, set the `useAPIKey` auth option to `true`. From there, a new interface will appear in the Admin panel for each document within the collection that allows you to generate an API key for each user in the Collection.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const ThirdPartyAccess: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'third-party-access',\n  auth: {\n    useAPIKey: true, // highlight-line\n  },\n  fields: [],\n}\n```\n\nUser API keys are encrypted within the database, meaning that if your database is compromised,\nyour API keys will not be.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  If you change your `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, you will need to regenerate your API keys.\n  <br />\n  The secret key is used to encrypt the API keys, so if you change the secret, existing API keys will\n  no longer be valid.\n</Banner>\n\n### HTTP Authentication\n\nTo authenticate REST or GraphQL API requests using an API key, set the `Authorization` header. The header is case-sensitive and needs the slug of the `auth.useAPIKey` enabled collection, then \" API-Key \", followed by the `apiKey` that has been assigned. Payload's built-in middleware will then assign the user document to `req.user` and handle requests with the proper access control. By doing this, Payload recognizes the request being made as a request by the user associated with that API key.\n\n**For example, using Fetch:**\n\n```ts\nimport Users from '../collections/Users'\n\nconst response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/pages', {\n  headers: {\n    Authorization: `${Users.slug} API-Key ${YOUR_API_KEY}`,\n  },\n})\n```\n\nPayload ensures that the same, uniform access control is used across all authentication strategies. This enables you to utilize your existing access control configurations with both API keys and the standard email/password authentication. This consistency can aid in maintaining granular control over your API keys.\n\n### API Key Only Auth\n\nIf you want to use API keys as the only authentication method for a collection, you can disable the default local strategy by setting `disableLocalStrategy` to `true` on the collection's `auth` property. This will disable the ability to authenticate with email and password, and will only allow for authentication via API key.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const ThirdPartyAccess: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'third-party-access',\n  auth: {\n    useAPIKey: true,\n    disableLocalStrategy: true, // highlight-line\n  },\n}\n```\n",

Otherwise,\n  just let Payload's built-in authentication handle user auth for you.\n</Banner>\n\n### Creating a strategy\n\nAt the core, a strategy is a way to authenticate a user making a request. As of `3.0` we moved away from passportJS in favor of pulling back the curtain and putting you in full control.\n\nA strategy is made up of the following:\n\n| Parameter                   | Description                                                               |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`name`** \\*               | The name of your strategy                                                 |\n| **`authenticate`**&nbsp;\\*  | A function that takes in the parameters below and returns a user or null. |\n\nThe `authenticate` function is passed the following arguments:\n\n| Argument            | Description                                                                                       |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`headers`** \\*    | The headers on the incoming request. Useful for retrieving identifiable information on a request. |\n| **`payload`** \\*    | The Payload class. Useful for authenticating the identifiable information against Payload.        |\n| **`isGraphQL`**     | Whether or not the request was made from a GraphQL endpoint. Default is `false`.                  |\n\n\n### Example Strategy\n\nAt its core a strategy simply takes information from the incoming request and returns a user. This is exactly how Payload's built-in strategies function.\n\nYour `authenticate` method should return an object containing a Payload user document and any optional headers that you'd like Payload to set for you when we return a response.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Users: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'users',\n  auth: {\n    disableLocalStrategy: true,\n    // highlight-start\n    strategies: [\n      {\n        name: 'custom-strategy',\n        authenticate: ({ payload, headers }) => {\n          const usersQuery = await payload.find({\n            collection: 'users',\n            where: {\n              code: {\n                equals: headers.get('code'),\n              },\n              secret: {\n                equals: headers.get('secret'),\n              },\n            },\n          })\n\n          return {\n            // Send the user back to authenticate,\n            // or send null if no user should be authenticated\n            user: usersQuery.docs[0] || null,\n\n            // Optionally, you can return headers\n            // that you'd like Payload to set here when\n            // it returns the response\n            responseHeaders: new Headers({\n              'some-header': 'my header value'\n            })\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n    // highlight-end\n  },\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'code',\n      type: 'text',\n      index: true,\n      unique: true,\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'secret',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n",

This data can be immensely helpful if your app needs to show and hide certain features based on access control, as the Payload Admin panel does.\n\n**REST API endpoint**:\n\n`GET http://localhost:3000/api/access`\n\nExample response:\n\n```ts\n{\n  canAccessAdmin: true,\n  collections: {\n    pages: {\n      create: {\n        permission: true,\n      },\n      read: {\n        permission: true,\n      },\n      update: {\n        permission: true,\n      },\n      delete: {\n        permission: true,\n      },\n      fields: {\n        title: {\n          create: {\n            permission: true,\n          },\n          read: {\n            permission: true,\n          },\n          update: {\n            permission: true,\n          },\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Query**:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  Access {\n    pages {\n      read {\n        permission\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDocument access can also be queried on a collection/global basis. Access on a global can queried like `http://localhost:3000/api/global-slug/access`, Collection document access can be queried like `http://localhost:3000/api/collection-slug/access/:id`.\n\n## Me\n\nReturns either a logged in user with token or null when there is no logged in user.\n\n**REST API endpoint**:\n\n`GET http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/me`\n\nExample response:\n\n```ts\n{\n  user: { // The JWT \"payload\" ;) from the logged in user\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    createdAt: \"2020-12-27T21:16:45.645Z\",\n    updatedAt: \"2021-01-02T18:37:41.588Z\",\n    id: \"5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832\"\n  },\n  token: '34o4345324...', // The token that can be used to authenticate the user\n  exp: 1609619861, // Unix timestamp representing when the user's token will expire\n}\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Query**:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  me[collection-singular-label] {\n    user {\n      email\n    }\n    exp\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Login\n\nAccepts an `email` and `password`. On success, it will return the logged in user as well as a token that can be used to authenticate. In the GraphQL and REST APIs, this operation also automatically sets an HTTP-only cookie including the user's token. If you pass a `res` to the Local API operation, Payload will set a cookie there as well.\n\n**Example REST API login**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/login', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    password: 'this-is-not-our-password...or-is-it?',\n  }),\n})\n\nconst json = await res.json()\n\n// JSON will be equal to the following:\n/*\n{\n  user: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    createdAt: \"2020-12-27T21:16:45.645Z\",\n    updatedAt: \"2021-01-02T18:37:41.588Z\",\n    id: \"5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832\"\n  },\n  token: '34o4345324...',\n  exp: 1609619861\n}\n*/\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  login[collection-singular-label](email: \"dev@payloadcms.com\", password: \"yikes\") {\n    user {\n      email\n    }\n    exp\n    token\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API login**:\n\n```ts\nconst result = await payload.login({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n  data: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    password: 'get-out',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Logout\n\nAs Payload sets HTTP-only cookies, logging out cannot be done by just removing a cookie in JavaScript, as HTTP-only cookies are inaccessible by JS within the browser. So, Payload exposes a `logout` operation to delete the token in a safe way.\n\n**Example REST API logout**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/logout', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  logout[collection-singular-label]\n}\n```\n\n## Refresh\n\nAllows for \"refreshing\" JWTs. If your user has a token that is about to expire, but the user is still active and using the app, you might want to use the `refresh` operation to receive a new token by executing this operation via the authenticated user.\n\nThis operation requires a non-expired token to send back a new one. If the user's token has already expired, you will need to allow them to log in again to retrieve a new token.\n\nIf successful, this operation will automatically renew the user's HTTP-only cookie and will send back the updated token in JSON.\n\n**Example REST API token refresh**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/refresh-token', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n\nconst json = await res.json()\n\n// JSON will be equal to the following:\n/*\n{\n  user: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    createdAt: \"2020-12-27T21:16:45.645Z\",\n    updatedAt: \"2021-01-02T18:37:41.588Z\",\n    id: \"5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832\"\n  },\n  refreshedToken: '34o4345324...',\n  exp: 1609619861\n}\n*/\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  refreshToken[collection-singular-label] {\n    user {\n      email\n    }\n    refreshedToken\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Verify by Email\n\nIf your collection supports email verification, the Verify operation will be exposed which accepts a verification token and sets the user's `_verified` property to `true`, thereby allowing the user to authenticate with the Payload API.\n\n**Example REST API user verification**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/verify/${TOKEN_HERE}`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  verifyEmail[collection-singular-label](token: \"TOKEN_HERE\")\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API verification**:\n\n```ts\nconst result = await payload.verifyEmail({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n  token: 'TOKEN_HERE',\n})\n```\n\n## Unlock\n\nIf a user locks themselves out and you wish to deliberately unlock them, you can utilize the Unlock operation. The Admin panel features an Unlock control automatically for all collections that feature max login attempts, but you can programmatically unlock users as well by using the Unlock operation.\n\nTo restrict who is allowed to unlock users, you can utilize the [`unlock`](../access-control/overview#unlock) access control function.\n\n**Example REST API unlock**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/unlock`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  unlock[collection-singular-label]\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API unlock**:\n\n```ts\nconst result = await payload.unlock({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n})\n```\n\n## Forgot Password\n\nPayload comes with built-in forgot password functionality. Submitting an email address to the Forgot Password operation will generate an email and send it to the respective email address with a link to reset their password.\n\nThe link to reset the user's password contains a token which is what allows the user to securely reset their password.\n\nBy default, the Forgot Password operations send users to the Payload Admin panel to reset their password, but you can customize the generated email to send users to the frontend of your app instead by [overriding the email HTML](../authentication/config#forgot-password).\n\n**Example REST API Forgot Password**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/forgot-password`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  forgotPassword[collection-singular-label](email: \"dev@payloadcms.com\")\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API forgot password**:\n\n```ts\nconst token = await payload.forgotPassword({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n  data: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  },\n  disableEmail: false, // you can disable the auto-generation of email via local API\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  You can stop the reset-password email from being sent via using the local API. This is helpful if\n  you need to create user accounts programmatically, but not set their password for them. This\n  effectively generates a reset password token which you can then use to send to a page you create,\n  allowing a user to \"complete\" their account by setting their password. In the background, you'd\n  use the token to \"reset\" their password.\n</Banner>\n\n## Reset Password\n\nAfter a user has \"forgotten\" their password and a token is generated, that token can be used to send to the reset password operation along with a new password which will allow the user to reset their password securely.\n\n**Example REST API Reset Password**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/reset-password`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    token: 'TOKEN_GOES_HERE'\n    password: 'not-today',\n  }),\n});\n\nconst json = await res.json();\n\n// JSON will be equal to the following:\n/*\n{\n  user: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    createdAt: \"2020-12-27T21:16:45.645Z\",\n    updatedAt: \"2021-01-02T18:37:41.588Z\",\n    id: \"5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832\"\n  },\n  token: '34o4345324...',\n  exp: 1609619861\n}\n*/\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  resetPassword[collection-singular-label](token: \"TOKEN_GOES_HERE\", password: \"not-today\")\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "\n<Banner>\n  Payload's powerful Versions functionality allows you to keep a running history of changes over\n  time and extensible to fit any content publishing workflow.\n</Banner>\n\nWhen enabled, Payload will automatically scaffold a new Collection in your database to store versions of your document(s) over time, and the Admin UI will be extended with additional views that allow you to browse document versions, view diffs in order to see exactly what has changed in your documents (and when they changed), and restore documents back to prior versions easily.\n\n![Versions](/images/docs/versions.png)\n_Comparing an old version to a newer version of a document_\n\n**With Versions, you can:**\n\n- Maintain an audit log / history of every change ever made to a document, including monitoring for what user made which change\n- Restore documents and globals to prior states in case you need to roll back changes\n- Build a true [Draft Preview](../versions/drafts) mode for your data\n- Manage who can see Drafts, and who can only see Published documents via [Access Control](../access-control/overview)\n- Enable [Autosave](../versions/autosave) on collections and globals to never lose your work again\n- Build a powerful publishing schedule mechanism to create documents and have them become publicly readable automatically at a future date\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Versions are extremely performant and totally opt-in. They don't change the shape of your data at\n  all. All versions are stored in a separate Collection and can be turned on and off easily at your\n  discretion.\n</Banner>\n\n## Options\n\nVersions support a few different levels of functionality that each come with their own impacts to document workflow.\n\n### Versions enabled, drafts disabled\n\nIf you enable versions but keep draft mode disabled, Payload will simply create a new version of a document each time you update a document. This is great for use cases where you need to retain a history of all document updates over time, but always want to treat the newest document version as the version that is \"published\".\n\nFor example, a use case for \"versions enabled, drafts disabled\" could be on a collection of users, where you might want to keep a version history (or audit log) of all changes ever made to users - but any changes to users should _always_ be treated as \"published\" and you have no need to maintain a \"draft\" version of a user.\n\n### Versions and drafts enabled\n\nIf you have versions _and_ drafts enabled, you are able to control which documents are published, and which are considered draft. That lets you write [access control](../access-control/overview) to control who can see published documents, and who can see draft documents. It also lets you save versions (drafts) that are _newer_ than your most recently published document, which is helpful if you want to draft changes and maybe even preview them before you publish the changes. Read more about Drafts [here](../versions/drafts).\n\n### Versions, drafts, and autosave enabled\n\nWhen you have versions, drafts, _and_ `autosave` enabled, the Admin UI will automatically save changes that you make to a new `draft` version as you edit a document, which makes sure that you never lose your changes ever again. Autosave will not affect your published post at all—instead, it'll just save your changes and let you publish them whenever you or your editors are ready to do so. Read more about Autosave [here](../versions/autosave).\n\n## Collection config\n\nConfiguring Versions is done by adding the `versions` key to your Collection configs. Set it to `true` to enable default Versions settings, or customize versions options by setting the property equal to an object containing the following available options:\n\n| Option      | Description                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `maxPerDoc` | Use this setting to control how many versions to keep on a document by document basis. Must be an integer. Defaults to 100, use 0 to save all versions.            |\n| `drafts `   | Enable [Drafts](../versions/drafts) mode for this collection. To enable, set to `true` or pass an object with `draft` [options](../versions/drafts#options). |\n\n## Global config\n\nGlobal versions work similarly to Collection versions but have a slightly different set of config properties supported.\n\n| Option   | Description                                                                                                                                                   |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `max`    | Use this setting to control how many versions to keep on a global by global basis. Must be an integer.                                                        |\n| `drafts` | Enable [Drafts](../versions/drafts) mode for this global. To enable, set to `true` or pass an object with `draft` [options](../versions/drafts#options) |\n\n### Database impact\n\nBy enabling `versions`, a new database collection will be made to store versions for your collection or global. The collection will be named based off the `slug` of the collection or global and will follow this pattern (where `slug` is replaced with the `slug` of your collection or global):\n\n```\n_slug_versions\n```\n\nEach document in this new `versions` collection will store a set of meta properties about the version as well as a _full_ copy of the document. For example, a version's data might look like this for a Collection document:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": \"61cf752c19cdf1b1af7b61f1\", // a unique ID of this version\n  \"parent\": \"61ce1354091d5b3ffc20ea6e\", // the ID of the parent document\n  \"autosave\": false, // used to denote if this version was created via autosave\n  \"version\": {\n    // your document's data goes here\n    // all fields are set to not required and this property can be partially complete\n  },\n  \"createdAt\": \"2021-12-31T21:25:00.992+00:00\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2021-12-31T21:25:00.992+00:00\"\n}\n```\n\nGlobal versions are stored the same as the collection version shown above, except they do not feature the `parent` property, as each Global receives its own `versions` collection. That means we know that all versions in that collection correspond to that specific global.\n\n## Version operations\n\nVersions expose new operations for both collections and globals. They allow you to find and query versions, find a single version by ID, and publish (or restore) a version by ID. Both Collections and Globals support the same new operations. They are used primarily by the admin UI, but if you are writing custom logic in your app and would like to utilize them, they're available for you to use as well via REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs.\n\n**Collection REST endpoints:**\n\n| Method | Path                                 | Description                       |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |\n| `GET`  | `/api/{collectionSlug}/versions`     | Find and query paginated versions |\n| `GET`  | `/api/{collectionSlug}/versions/:id` | Find a specific version by ID     |\n| `POST` | `/api/{collectionSlug}/versions/:id` | Restore a version by ID           |\n\n**Collection GraphQL queries:**\n\n| Query Name                               | Operation         |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| **`version{collection.label.singular}`** | `findVersionByID` |\n| **`versions{collection.label.plural}`**  | `findVersions`    |\n\n**And mutation:**\n\n| Query Name                                      | Operation        |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| **`restoreVersion{collection.label.singular}`** | `restoreVersion` |\n\n**Collection Local API methods:**\n\n### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be a paginated set of Versions.\n// See /docs/queries/pagination for more.\nconst result = await payload.findVersions({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  page: 1,\n  limit: 10,\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  sort: '-createdAt',\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Find by ID\n\n```js\n// Result will be a Post document.\nconst result = await payload.findVersionByID({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Restore\n\n```js\n// Result will be the restored global document.\nconst result = await payload.restoreVersion({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n**Global REST endpoints:**\n\n| Method | Path                                     | Description                       |\n| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |\n| `GET`  | `/api/globals/{globalSlug}/versions`     | Find and query paginated versions |\n| `GET`  | `/api/globals/{globalSlug}/versions/:id` | Find a specific version by ID     |\n| `POST` | `/api/globals/{globalSlug}/versions/:id` | Restore a version by ID           |\n\n**Global GraphQL queries:**\n\n| Query Name                   | Operation         |\n| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| **`version{global.label}`**  | `findVersionByID` |\n| **`versions{global.label}`** | `findVersions`    |\n\n**Global GraphQL mutation:**\n\n| Query Name                         | Operation        |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| **`restoreVersion{global.label}`** | `restoreVersion` |\n\n**Global Local API methods:**\n\n### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be a paginated set of Versions.\n// See /docs/queries/pagination for more.\nconst result = await payload.findGlobalVersions({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  page: 1,\n  limit: 10,\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  sort: '-createdAt',\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Find by ID\n\n```js\n// Result will be a Post document.\nconst result = await payload.findGlobalVersionByID({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Restore\n\n```js\n// Result will be the restored global document.\nconst result = await payload.restoreGlobalVersion({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n## Access Control\n\nVersions expose a new access control function on both Collections and Globals that allow for you to control who can see versions of documents, and who can't.\n\n**New version access control:**\n\n| Function           | Allows/Denies Access                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`readVersions`** | Used to control who can read versions, and who can't.

This functionality allows you to build powerful Preview environments for your data, where you can make sure your changes look good before publishing documents.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">Drafts rely on Versions being enabled in order to function.</Banner>\n\nBy enabling Versions with Drafts, your collections and globals can maintain _newer_, and _unpublished_ versions of your documents. It's perfect for cases where you might want to work on a document, update it and save your progress, but not necessarily make it publicly published right away. Drafts are extremely helpful when building preview implementations.\n\n![Drafts Enabled](/images/docs/drafts-enabled.png)\n_If Drafts are enabled, the typical Save button is replaced with new actions which allow you to either save a draft, or publish your changes._\n\n## Options\n\nCollections and Globals both support the same options for configuring drafts. You can either set `versions.drafts` to `true`, or pass an object to configure draft properties.\n\n| Draft Option | Description                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `autosave`   | Enable `autosave` to automatically save progress while documents are edited. To enable, set to `true` or pass an object with [options](../versions/autosave). |\n| `validate`   | Set `validate` to `true` to validate draft documents when saved. Default is `false`.                                                                             |\n\n## Database changes\n\nBy enabling drafts on a collection or a global, Payload will <strong>automatically inject a new field into your schema</strong> called `_status`. The `_status` field is used internally by Payload to store if a document is set to `draft` or `published`.\n\n**Admin UI status indication**\n\nWithin the Admin UI, if drafts are enabled, a document can be shown with one of three \"statuses\":\n\n1. <strong>Draft</strong> - if a document has never been published, and only draft versions of the document\n   are present\n1. <strong>Published</strong> - if a document is published and there are no newer drafts available\n1. <strong>Changed</strong> - if a document has been published, but there are newer drafts available\n   and not yet published\n\n## Draft API\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  If drafts are enabled on your collection or global, important and powerful changes are made to\n  your REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs that allow you to specify if you are interacting with drafts or\n  with live documents.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Updating or creating drafts\n\nIf you enable drafts on a collection or global, the `create` and `update` operations for REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs expose a new option called `draft` which allows you to specify if you are creating or updating a <strong>draft</strong>, or if you're just sending your changes straight to the published document. For example, if you pass the query parameter `?draft=true` to a REST `create` or `update` operation, your action will be treated as if you are creating a `draft` and not a published document. By default, the `draft` argument is set to `false`.\n\n**Required fields**\n\nIf `draft` is enabled while creating or updating a document, all fields are considered as not required, so that you can save drafts that are incomplete.\n\n#### Reading drafts vs. published documents\n\nIn addition to the `draft` argument within `create` and `update` operations, a `draft` argument is also exposed for `find` and `findByID` operations.\n\nIf `draft` is set to `true` while reading a document, <strong>Payload will automatically replace returned document(s) with their newest drafts</strong> if any newer drafts are available.\n\n<strong>For example, let's take the following scenario:</strong>\n\n1. You create a new collection document and publish it right away\n1. You then make some updates, and save the updates as a draft\n1. You then make some further updates, and save more updates as another draft\n\nHere, you will have a published document that resides in your main collection, and then you'll have two _newer_ drafts that reside in the `_[collectionSlug]_versions` database collection.\n\nIf you simply fetch your created document using a `find` or `findByID` operation, your published document will be returned and the drafts will be ignored.\n\nBut, if you specify `draft` as `true`, Payload will automatically replace your published document's content with content coming from the most recently saved `version`. In this case, as we have created _two_ versions in the above scenario, Payload will send back data from the newest (second) draft and your document will appear as the most recently drafted version instead of the published version.\n\n## Controlling who can see Collection drafts\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  If you're using the <strong>drafts</strong> feature, it's important for you to consider who can\n  view your drafts, and who can view only published documents. Luckily, Payload makes this extremely\n  simple and puts the power completely in your hands.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Restricting draft access\n\nYou can use the `read` [Access Control](../access-control/collections#read) method to restrict who is able to view drafts of your documents by simply returning a [query constraint](../queries/overview) which restricts the documents that any given user is able to retrieve.\n\nHere is an example that utilizes the `_status` field to require a user to be logged in to retrieve drafts:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  access: {\n    read: ({ req }) => {\n      // If there is a user logged in,\n      // let them retrieve all documents\n      if (req.user) return true\n\n      // If there is no user,\n      // restrict the documents that are returned\n      // to only those where `_status` is equal to `published`\n      return {\n        _status: {\n          equals: 'published',\n        },\n      }\n    },\n  },\n  versions: {\n    drafts: true,\n  },\n  //.. the rest of the Pages config here\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note regarding adding versions to an existing collection</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you already have a collection with documents, and you <em>opt in</em> to draft functionality\n  after you have already created existing documents, all of your old documents{' '}\n  <em>will not have a _status field</em> until you resave them. For this reason, if you are{' '}\n  <em>adding</em> versions into an existing collection, you might want to write your access control\n  function to allow for users to read both documents where{' '}\n  <strong>_status is equal to \"published\"</strong> as well as where{' '}\n  <strong>_status does not exist</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\nHere is an example for how to write an access control function that grants access to both documents where `_status` is equal to \"published\" and where `_status` does not exist:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  access: {\n    read: ({ req }) => {\n      // If there is a user logged in,\n      // let them retrieve all documents\n      if (req.user) return true\n\n      // If there is no user,\n      // restrict the documents that are returned\n      // to only those where `_status` is equal to `published`\n      // or where `_status` does not exist\n      return {\n        or: [\n          {\n            _status: {\n              equals: 'published',\n            },\n          },\n          {\n            _status: {\n              exists: false,\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      }\n    },\n  },\n  versions: {\n    drafts: true,\n  },\n  //.. the rest of the Pages config here\n}\n```\n\n## Unpublishing drafts\n\nIf a document is published, the Payload Admin UI will be updated to show an \"unpublish\" button at the top of the sidebar, which will \"unpublish\" the currently published document. Consider this as a way to \"revert\" a document back to a draft state. On the API side, this is done by simply setting `_status: 'draft'` on any document.\n\n## Reverting to published\n\nIf a document is published, and you have made further changes which are saved as a draft, Payload will show a \"revert to published\" button at the top of the sidebar which will allow you to reject your draft changes and \"revert\" back to the published state of the document. Your drafts will still be saved, but a new version will be created that will reflect the last published state of the document.\n",

Never lose your work - and publish changes to the live document only when you're ready.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Autosave relies on Versions and Drafts being enabled in order to function.\n</Banner>\n\n![Autosave Enabled](/images/docs/autosave-enabled.png)\n_If Autosave is enabled, drafts will be created automatically as the document is modified and the Admin UI adds an indicator describing when the document was last saved to the top right of the sidebar._\n\n## Options\n\nCollections and Globals both support the same options for configuring autosave. You can either set `versions.drafts.autosave` to `true`, or pass an object to configure autosave properties.\n\n| Drafts Autosave Options | Description                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `interval`              | Define an `interval` in milliseconds to automatically save progress while documents are edited. Document updates are \"debounced\" at this interval. Defaults to `800`. |\n\n**Example config with versions, drafts, and autosave enabled:**\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  access: {\n    read: ({ req }) => {\n      // If there is a user logged in,\n      // let them retrieve all documents\n      if (req.user) return true\n\n      // If there is no user,\n      // restrict the documents that are returned\n      // to only those where `_status` is equal to `published`\n      return {\n        _status: {\n          equals: 'published',\n        },\n      }\n    },\n  },\n  versions: {\n    drafts: {\n      autosave: true,\n\n      // Alternatively, you can specify an `interval`:\n      // autosave: {\n      //   interval: 1500,\n      // },\n    },\n  },\n  //.. the rest of the Pages config here\n}\n```\n\n## Autosave API\n\nWhen `autosave` is enabled, all `update` operations within Payload expose a new argument called `autosave`. When set to `true`, Payload will treat the incoming draft update as an `autosave`. This is primarily used by the Admin UI, but there may be some cases where you are building an app for your users and wish to implement `autosave` in your own app. To do so, use the `autosave` argument in your `update` operations.\n\n### How autosaves are stored\n\nIf we created a new version for each autosave, you'd quickly find a ton of autosaves that clutter up your `_versions` collection within the database. That would be messy quick because `autosave` is typically set to save a document at ~800ms intervals.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Instead of creating a new version each time a document is autosaved, Payload smartly only creates{' '}\n  <strong>one</strong> autosave version, and then updates that specific version with each autosave\n  performed. This makes sure that your versions remain nice and tidy.\n</Banner>\n",

[Click here](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#api) for more documentation about what you can control.\n\nA common example of what you might want to customize within Payload-wide Upload options would be to increase the allowed `fileSize` of uploads sent to Payload:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'media',\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'alt',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n      ],\n      upload: true,\n    },\n  ],\n  upload: {\n    limits: {\n      fileSize: 5000000, // 5MB, written in bytes\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Image Sizes\n\nIf you specify an array of `imageSizes` to your `upload` config, Payload will automatically crop and resize your uploads to fit each of the sizes specified by your config.\n\nThe Payload Admin panel will also automatically display all available files, including width, height, and filesize, for each of your uploaded files.\n\nBehind the scenes, Payload relies on [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize#resize) to perform its image resizing. You can specify additional options for `sharp` to use while resizing your images.\n\n#### Accessing the resized images in hooks\n\nAll auto-resized images are exposed to be re-used in hooks and similar via an object that is bound to `req.payloadUploadSizes`.\n\nThe object will have keys for each size generated, and each key will be set equal to a buffer containing the file data.\n\n#### Handling Image Enlargement\n\nWhen an uploaded image is smaller than the defined image size, we have 3 options:\n\n`withoutEnlargement: undefined | false | true`\n\n1. `undefined` [default]: uploading images with smaller width AND height than the image size will return null\n2. `false`: always enlarge images to the image size\n3. `true`: if the image is smaller than the image size, return the original image\n\n<Banner type=\"error\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  By default, the image size will return NULL when the uploaded image is smaller than the defined\n  image size. Use the `withoutEnlargement` prop to change this.\n</Banner>\n\n## Crop and Focal Point Selector\n\nThis feature is only available for image file types.\n\nSetting `crop: false` and `focalPoint: false` in your Upload config will be disable the respective selector in the Admin panel.\n\nImage cropping occurs before any resizing, the resized images will therefore be generated from the cropped image (**not** the original image).\n\nIf no resizing options are specified (`imageSizes` or `resizeOptions`), the focal point selector will not be displayed.\n\n## Disabling Local Upload Storage\n\nIf you are using a plugin to send your files off to a third-party file storage host or CDN, like Amazon S3 or similar, you may not want to store your files locally at all. You can prevent Payload from writing files to disk by specifying `disableLocalStorage: true` on your collection's upload config.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  This is a fairly advanced feature. If you do disable local file storage, by default, your admin\n  panel's thumbnails will be broken as you will not have stored a file. It will be totally up to you\n  to use either a plugin or your own hooks to store your files in a permanent manner, as well as\n  provide your own admin thumbnail using <strong>upload.adminThumbnail</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\n## Admin Thumbnails\n\nYou can specify how Payload retrieves admin thumbnails for your upload-enabled Collections with one of the following:\n\n1. `adminThumbnail` as a **string**, equal to one of your provided image size names.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Media: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'media',\n  upload: {\n    // highlight-start\n    adminThumbnail: 'small',\n    // highlight-end\n    imageSizes: [\n      {\n        name: 'small',\n        fit: 'cover',\n        height: 300,\n        width: 900,\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'large',\n        fit: 'cover',\n        height: 600,\n        width: 1800,\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. `adminThumbnail` as a **function** that takes the document's data and sends back a full URL to load the thumbnail.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Media: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'media',\n  upload: {\n    // highlight-start\n    adminThumbnail: ({ doc }) => `https://google.com/custom-path-to-file/${doc.filename}`,\n    // highlight-end\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MimeTypes\n\nSpecifying the `mimeTypes` property can restrict what files are allowed from the user's file picker. This accepts an array of strings, which can be any valid mimetype or mimetype wildcards\n\nSome example values are: `image/*`, `audio/*`, `video/*`, `image/png`, `application/pdf`\n\n**Example mimeTypes usage:**\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Media: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'media',\n  upload: {\n    mimeTypes: ['image/*', 'application/pdf'], // highlight-line\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Uploading Files\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Uploading files is currently only possible through the REST and Local APIs due to how GraphQL\n  works. It's difficult and fairly nonsensical to support uploading files through GraphQL.\n</Banner>\n\nTo upload a file, use your collection's [`create`](../rest-api/overview#collections) endpoint. Send it all the data that your Collection requires, as well as a `file` key containing the file that you'd like to upload.\n\nSend your request as a `multipart/form-data` request, using [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) if possible.\n\n```ts\nconst fileInput = document.querySelector('#your-file-input') ;\nconst formData = new FormData();\n\nformData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);\n\nfetch('api/:upload-slug', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: formData,\n  /**\n   * Do not manually add the Content-Type Header\n   * the browser will handle this.\n   *\n   * headers: {\n   *  'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'\n   * }\n   */\n})\n```\n\n## Access Control\n\nAll files that are uploaded to each Collection automatically support the `read` [Access Control](../access-control/overview) function from the Collection itself. You can use this to control who should be allowed to see your uploads, and who should not.\n",

The same `read` access control property on your `upload`-enabled collections is used, and it allows you to restrict who can request your uploaded files.\n\nTo preserve this feature, by default, this plugin _keeps all file URLs exactly the same_. Your file URLs won't be updated to point directly to your cloud storage source, as in that case, Payload's access control will be completely bypassed and you would need public readability on your cloud-hosted files.\n\nInstead, all uploads will still be reached from the default `/collectionSlug/staticURL/filename` path. This plugin will \"pass through\" all files that are hosted on your third-party cloud service—with the added benefit of keeping your existing access control in place.\n\nIf this does not apply to you (your upload collection has `read: () => true` or similar) you can disable this functionality by setting `disablePayloadAccessControl` to `true`. When this setting is in place, this plugin will update your file URLs to point directly to your cloud host.\n\n## Conditionally Enabling/Disabling\n\nThe proper way to conditionally enable/disable this plugin is to use the `enabled` property.\n\n```ts\ncloudStoragePlugin({\n  enabled: process.env.MY_CONDITION === 'true',\n  collections: {\n    'my-collection-slug': {\n      adapter: theAdapterToUse, // see docs for the adapter you want to use\n    },\n  },\n}),\n```\n",

If you have a collection as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'\n\nexport const PublicUser: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'public-users',\n  auth: true, // Auth is enabled\n  fields: [\n    ...\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Payload will automatically open up the following queries:**\n\n| Query Name              | Operation           |\n| ------------------      | ------------------- |\n| `PublicUser`        | `findByID`          |\n| `PublicUsers`       | `find`              |\n| `countPublicUsers`  | `count`             |\n| `mePublicUser`      | `me` auth operation |\n\n**And the following mutations:**\n\n| Query Name                     | Operation                       |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| `createPublicUser`         | `create`                        |\n| `updatePublicUser`         | `update`                        |\n| `deletePublicUser`         | `delete`                        |\n| `forgotPasswordPublicUser` | `forgotPassword` auth operation |\n| `resetPasswordPublicUser`  | `resetPassword` auth operation  |\n| `unlockPublicUser`         | `unlock` auth operation         |\n| `verifyPublicUser`         | `verify` auth operation         |\n| `loginPublicUser`          | `login` auth operation          |\n| `logoutPublicUser`         | `logout` auth operation         |\n| `refreshTokenPublicUser`   | `refresh` auth operation        |\n\n## Globals\n\nGlobals are also fully supported. For example:\n\n```ts\nimport type { GlobalConfig } from 'payload';\n\nconst Header: GlobalConfig = {\n  slug: 'header',\n  fields: [\n    ...\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Payload will open the following query:**\n\n| Query Name   | Operation |\n| ------------ | --------- |\n| `Header` | `findOne` |\n\n**And the following mutation:**\n\n| Query Name         | Operation |\n| ------------------ | --------- |\n| `updateHeader` | `update`  |\n\n## Preferences\n\nUser [preferences](../admin/overview#preferences) for the admin panel are also available to GraphQL the same way as other collection schemas are generated. To query preferences you must supply an authorization token in the header and only the preferences of that user will be accessible.\n\n**Payload will open the following query:**\n\n| Query Name       | Operation |\n| ---------------- | --------- |\n| `Preference` | `findOne` |\n\n**And the following mutations:**\n\n| Query Name             | Operation |\n| ---------------------- | --------- |\n| `updatePreference` | `update`  |\n| `deletePreference` | `delete`  |\n\n## GraphQL Playground\n\nGraphQL Playground is enabled by default for development purposes, but disabled in production. You can enable it in production by passing `graphQL.disablePlaygroundInProduction` a `false` setting in the main Payload config.\n\nYou can even log in using the `login[collection-singular-label-here]` mutation to use the Playground as an authenticated user.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  To see more regarding how the above queries and mutations are used, visit your GraphQL playground\n  (by default at\n  [`${SERVER_URL}/api/graphql-playground`](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql-playground))\n  while your server is running. There, you can use the \"Schema\" and \"Docs\" buttons on the right to\n  see a ton of detail about how GraphQL operates within Payload.\n</Banner>\n\n## Query complexity limits\n\nPayload comes with a built-in query complexity limiter to prevent bad people from trying to slow down your server by running massive queries.

You should not install your own copy of GraphQL as a dependency due to underlying restrictions based on how GraphQL works. Instead, you can use the Payload-provided copy via this argument.\n\n**`payload`**\n\nThis is a copy of the currently running Payload instance, which provides you with existing GraphQL types for all of your Collections and Globals - among other things.\n\n## Return value\n\nBoth `graphQL.queries` and `graphQL.mutations` functions should return an object with properties equal to your newly written GraphQL queries and mutations.\n\n## Example\n\n`payload.config.js`:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload'\nimport myCustomQueryResolver from './graphQL/resolvers/myCustomQueryResolver'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  graphQL: {\n    // highlight-start\n    queries: (GraphQL, payload) => {\n      return {\n        MyCustomQuery: {\n          type: new GraphQL.GraphQLObjectType({\n            name: 'MyCustomQuery',\n            fields: {\n              text: {\n                type: GraphQL.GraphQLString,\n              },\n              someNumberField: {\n                type: GraphQL.GraphQLFloat,\n              },\n            },\n          }),\n          args: {\n            argNameHere: {\n              type: new GraphQL.GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString),\n            },\n          },\n          resolve: myCustomQueryResolver,\n        },\n      }\n    },\n    // highlight-end\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Resolver function\n\nIn your resolver, make sure you set `depth: 0` if you're returning data directly from the local API so that GraphQL can correctly resolve queries to nested values such as relationship data.\n\nYour function will receive four arguments you can make use of:\n\nExample\n\n```ts\n;async (obj, args, context, info) => {}\n```\n\n**`obj`**\n\nThe previous object. Not very often used and usually discarded.\n\n**`args`**\n\nThe available arguments from your query or mutation will be available to you here, these must be configured via the custom operation first.\n\n**`context`**\n\nAn object containing the `req` and `res` objects that will provide you with the `payload`, `user` instances and more, like any other Payload API handler.\n\n**`info`**\n\nContextual information about the currently running GraphQL operation. You can get schema information from this as well as contextual information about where this resolver function is being run.\n\n## Types\n\nWe've exposed a few types and utilities to help you extend the API further. Payload uses the GraphQL.js package for which you can view the full list of available types in the [official documentation](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/).\n\n**`GraphQLJSON`** & **`GraphQLJSONObject`**\n\n```ts\nimport { GraphQLJSON, GraphQLJSONObject } from '@payloadcms/graphql/types'\n```\n\n**`GraphQL`**\n\nYou can directly import the GraphQL package used by Payload, most useful for typing.\n\n```ts\nimport { GraphQL } from '@payloadcms/graphql/types'\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  For queries, mutations and handlers make sure you use the `GraphQL` and `payload` instances provided via arguments.\n</Banner>\n\n\n**`buildPaginatedListType`**\n\nThis is a utility function that allows you to build a new GraphQL type for a paginated result similar to the Payload's generated schema.\nIt takes in two arguments, the first for the name of this new schema type and the second for the GraphQL type to be used in the docs parameter.\n\nExample\n\n```ts\nimport { buildPaginatedListType } from '@payloadcms/graphql/types'\n\nexport const getMyPosts = (GraphQL, payload) => {\n  return {\n    args: {},\n    resolve: Resolver,\n    // The name of your new type has to be unique\n    type: buildPaginatedListType('AuthorPosts', payload.collections['posts'].graphQL?.type),\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**`payload.collections.slug.graphQL`**\n\nIf you want to extend more of the provided API then the `graphQL` object on your collection slug will contain additional types to help you re-use code for types, mutations and queries.\n\n```ts\ngraphQL?: {\n  type: GraphQLObjectType\n  paginatedType: GraphQLObjectType\n  JWT: GraphQLObjectType\n  versionType: GraphQLObjectType\n  whereInputType: GraphQLInputObjectType\n  mutationInputType: GraphQLNonNull<any>\n  updateMutationInputType: GraphQLNonNull<any>\n}\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\nThere are a few ways to structure your code, we recommend using a dedicated `graphql` directory so you can keep all of your logic in one place. You have total freedom of how you want to structure this but a common pattern is to group functions by type and with their resolver.\n\nExample\n\n```\nsrc/graphql\n---- queries/\n     index.ts\n    -- myCustomQuery/\n       index.ts\n       resolver.ts\n\n---- mutations/\n```\n",

All you need to do is run the generate command and the entire schema will be created for you.\n\n## Schema generation script\n\nInstall `@payloadcms/graphql` as a dev dependency:\n\n```bash\npnpm add @payloadcms/graphql --save-dev\n```\n\nRun the following command to generate the schema:\n\n```bash\npnpm payload-graphql generate:schema\n```\n\n## Custom Field Schemas\n\nFor `array`, `block`, `group` and named `tab` fields, you can generate top level reusable interfaces. The following group field config:\n\n```ts\n{\n  type: 'group',\n  name: 'meta',\n  interfaceName: 'SharedMeta', // highlight-line\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'description',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nwill generate:\n\n```ts\n// A top level reusable type will be generated\ntype SharedMeta {\n  title: String\n  description: String\n}\n\n// And will be referenced inside the generated schema\ntype Collection1 {\n  // ...other fields\n  meta: SharedMeta\n}\n```\n\nThe above example outputs all your definitions to a file relative from your payload config as `./graphql/schema.graphql`. By default, the file will be output to your current working directory as `schema.graphql`.\n\n### Adding an NPM script\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important</strong>\n  <br />\n  Payload needs to be able to find your config to generate your GraphQL schema.\n</Banner>\n\nPayload will automatically try and locate your config, but might not always be able to find it. For example, if you are working in a `/src` directory or similar, you need to tell Payload where to find your config manually by using an environment variable.\n\nIf this applies to you, create an NPM script to make generating types easier:\n\n```json\n// package.json\n\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"generate:graphQLSchema\": \"cross-env PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload-graphql generate:schema\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can run `pnpm generate:graphQLSchema` to easily generate your schema.\n",

deleted, so there are only two REST endpoints opened:\n\n<RestExamples\n  data={[\n    {\n      operation: 'Get Global',\n      method: 'GET',\n      path: '/api/globals/{global-slug}',\n

Payload also has REST endpoints to manage the admin user [preferences](../admin/overview#preferences) for data specific to the authenticated user.\n\n<RestExamples\n  data={[\n    {\n      operation: 'Get Preference',\n      method: 'GET',\n      path: '/api/payload-preferences/{key}',\n      description: 'Get a preference by key',\n      example: {\n        slug: 'getPreference',\n        req:

res: {\n          message: 'deletedSuccessfully',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Custom Endpoints\n\nAdditional REST API endpoints can be added to your application by providing an array of `endpoints` in various places within a Payload config. Custom endpoints are useful for adding additional middleware on existing routes or for building custom functionality into Payload apps and plugins. Endpoints can be added at the top of the Payload config, `collections`, and `globals` and accessed respective of the api and slugs you have configured.\n\nEach endpoint object needs to have:\n\n| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`path`**    | A string for the endpoint route after the collection or globals slug                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **`method`**  | The lowercase HTTP verb to use: 'get', 'head', 'post', 'put', 'delete', 'connect' or 'options'                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **`handler`** | A function or array of functions to be called with **req**, **res** and **next** arguments. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)                                                                                          |\n| **`root`**    | When `true`, defines the endpoint on the root Next.js app, bypassing Payload handlers and the `routes.api` subpath. Note: this only applies to top-level endpoints of your Payload config, endpoints defined on `collections` or `globals` cannot be root. |\n| **`custom`**  | Extension point for adding custom data (e.g. for plugins)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\n// a collection of 'orders' with an additional route for tracking details, reachable at /api/orders/:id/tracking\nexport const Orders: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'orders',\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n  // highlight-start\n  endpoints: [\n    {\n      path: '/:id/tracking',\n      method: 'get',\n      handler: (req) => {\n        const tracking = await getTrackingInfo(req.params.id)\n\n        if (!tracking) {\n          return Response.json({ error: 'not found' }, { status: 404})\n        }\n\n        return Response.json({\n          message: `Hello ${req.routeParams.name as string} @ ${req.routeParams.group as string}`,\n        })\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      path: '/:id/tracking',\n      method: 'post',\n      handler: (req) => {\n        // `data` is not automatically appended to the request\n        // if you would like to read the body of the request\n        // you can use `data = await req.json()`\n        const data = await req.json()\n        await req.payload.update({\n          collection: 'tracking',\n          data: {\n            // data to update the document with\n          }\n        })\n        return Response.json({\n          message: 'successfully updated tracking info'\n        })\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  **req** will have the **payload** object and can be used inside your endpoint handlers for making\n  calls like req.payload.find() that will make use of access control and hooks.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Helpful tips\n`req.data`\n\nData is not automatically appended to the request. You can read the body data by calling `await req.json()`.\n\nOr you could use our helper function that mutates the request and appends data and file if found.\n\n```ts\nimport { addDataAndFileToRequest } from '@payloadcms/next/utilities'\n\n// custom endpoint example\n{\n  path: '/:id/tracking',\n  method: 'post',\n  handler: (req) => {\n    await addDataAndFileToRequest(req)\n    await req.payload.update({\n      collection: 'tracking',\n      data: {\n        // data to update the document with\n      }\n    })\n    return Response.json({\n      message: 'successfully updated tracking info'\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`req.locale` & `req.fallbackLocale`\n\nThe locale and the fallback locale are not automatically appended to custom endpoint requests. If you would like to add them you can use this helper function.\n\n```ts\nimport { addLocalesToRequestFromData } from '@payloadcms/next/utilities'\n\n// custom endpoint example\n{\n  path: '/:id/tracking',\n  method: 'post',\n  handler: (req) => {\n    await addLocalesToRequestFromData(req)\n    // you now can access req.locale & req.fallbackLocale\n    return Response.json({ message: 'success' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Method Override for GET Requests\n\nPayload supports a method override feature that allows you to send GET requests using the HTTP POST method. This can be particularly useful in scenarios when the query string in a regular GET request is too long.\n\n### How to Use\n\nTo use this feature, include the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header set to `GET` in your POST request. The parameters should be sent in the body of the request with the `Content-Type` set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is an example of how to use the method override to perform a GET request:\n\n#### Using Method Override (POST)\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`${api}/${collectionSlug}`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  credentials: 'include',\n  headers: {\n    'Accept-Language': i18n.language,\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n    'X-HTTP-Method-Override': 'GET',\n  },\n  body: qs.stringify({\n    depth: 1,\n    locale: 'en',\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n#### Equivalent Regular GET Request\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`${api}/${collectionSlug}?depth=1&locale=en`, {\n  method: 'GET',\n  credentials: 'include',\n  headers: {\n    'Accept-Language': i18n.language,\n  },\n})\n```\n",

        "content": "\nThe Payload Local API gives you the ability to execute the same operations that are available through REST and GraphQL within Node, directly on your server. Here, you don't need to deal with server latency or network speed whatsoever and can interact directly with your database.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The Local API is incredibly powerful when used in React Server Components and other similar server-side contexts. With other headless CMS, you need to request your data from third-party servers via an HTTP layer, which can add significant loading time to your server-rendered pages. With Payload, you don't have to leave your server to gather the data you need. It can be incredibly fast and is definitely a game changer.\n</Banner>\n\nHere are some common examples of how you can use the Local API:\n\n- Fetching Payload data within React Server Components\n- Seeding data via Node seed scripts that you write and maintain\n- Opening custom Next.js route handlers which feature additional functionality but still rely on Payload\n- Within Payload access control and hook functions\n- Within access control and hook functions\n\n## Accessing Payload\n\nYou can gain access to the currently running `payload` object via two ways:\n\n#### Accessing from args or `req`\n\nIn most places within Payload itself, you can access `payload` directly from the arguments of hooks, access control, validation functions, and similar. This is the simplest way to access Payload in most cases. Most config functions take the `req` (Request) object, which has Payload bound to it (`req.payload`).\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nconst afterChangeHook: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({ req: { payload } }) => {\n  const posts = await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n#### Importing it\n\nIf you want to import Payload in places where you don't have the option to access it from function arguments or `req`, you can import it and initialize it.\n\nThere are two places to import Payload:\n\n**Option 1 - using HMR, within Next.js**\n\n```ts\nimport { getPayloadHMR } from '@payloadcms/next/utilities'\nimport config from '@payload-config'\n\nconst payload = await getPayloadHMR({ config })\n```\n\nYou should import Payload using the first option (`getPayloadHMR`) if you are using Payload inside of Next.js (like route handlers, server components, and similar.) \n\nThis way, in Next.js development mode, Payload will work with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and as you make changes to your Payload config, your usage of Payload will always be in sync with your changes. In production, `getPayloadHMR` simply disables all HMR functionality so you don't need to write your code any differently. We handle optimization for you in production mode.\n\nIf you are accessing Payload via function arguments or `req.payload`, HMR is automatically supported if you are using it within Next.js.\n\n**Option 2 - outside of Next.js**\n\nIf you are using Payload outside of Next.js, for example in standalone scripts or in other frameworks, you can import Payload with no HMR functionality.\n\n```ts\nimport { getPayload } from 'payload'\nimport { importConfig } from 'payload/node'\n\nconst config = await importConfig('./payload.config.ts')\nconst payload = await getPayload({ config })\n```\n\nBoth options function in exactly the same way outside of one having HMR support and the other not. However, when you import your Payload config, you need to make sure that you can import it safely. \n\nFor more information about using Payload outside of Next.js, [click here](../beta/local-api/outside-nextjs).\n\n## Local options available\n\nYou can specify more options within the Local API vs. REST or GraphQL due to the server-only context that they are executed in.\n\n| Local Option       | Description  |\n| ------------------ | ------------ |\n| `collection`       | Required for Collection operations. Specifies the Collection slug to operate against. |\n| `data`             | The data to use within the operation. Required for `create`, `update`. |\n| `depth`            | [Control auto-population](../getting-started/concepts#depth) of nested relationship and upload fields. |\n| `locale`           | Specify [locale](../configuration/localization) for any returned documents. |\n| `fallbackLocale`   | Specify a [fallback locale](../configuration/localization) to use for any returned documents. |\n| `overrideAccess`   | Skip access control. By default, this property is set to true within all Local API operations. |\n| `user`             | If you set `overrideAccess` to `false`, you can pass a user to use against the access control checks. |\n| `showHiddenFields` | Opt-in to receiving hidden fields. By default, they are hidden from returned documents in accordance to your config. |\n| `pagination`       | Set to false to return all documents and avoid querying for document counts. |\n| `context`          | [Context](../hooks/context), which will then be passed to `context` and `req.context`, which can be read by hooks. Useful if you want to pass additional information to the hooks which shouldn't be necessarily part of the document, for example a `triggerBeforeChange` option which can be read by the BeforeChange hook to determine if it should run or not. |\n\n_There are more options available on an operation by operation basis outlined below._\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  By default, all access control checks are disabled in the Local API, but you can re-enable them if\n  you'd like, as well as pass a specific user to run the operation with.\n</Banner>\n\n## Collections\n\nThe following Collection operations are available through the Local API:\n\n### Create\n\n```js\n// The created Post document is returned\nconst post = await payload.create({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    title: 'sure',\n    description: 'maybe',\n  },\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUserDoc,\n  overrideAccess: true,\n  showHiddenFields: false,\n\n  // If creating verification-enabled auth doc,\n  // you can optionally disable the email that is auto-sent\n  disableVerificationEmail: true,\n\n  // If your collection supports uploads, you can upload\n  // a file directly through the Local API by providing\n  // its full, absolute file path.\n  filePath: path.resolve(__dirname, './path-to-image.jpg'),\n\n  // Alternatively, you can directly pass a File,\n  // if file is provided, filePath will be omitted\n  file: uploadedFile,\n})\n```\n\n### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be a paginated set of Posts.\n// See /docs/queries/pagination for more.\nconst result = await payload.find({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  page: 1,\n  limit: 10,\n  pagination: false, // If you want to disable pagination count, etc.\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  sort: '-title',\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Find by ID\n\n```js\n// Result will be a Post document.\nconst result = await payload.findByID({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Count\n\n```js\n// Result will be an object with:\n// {\n//   totalDocs: 10, // count of the documents satisfies query\n// }\nconst result = await payload.count({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  locale: 'en',\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n})\n```\n\n### Update by ID\n\n```js\n// Result will be the updated Post document.\nconst result = await payload.update({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    title: 'sure',\n    description: 'maybe',\n  },\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n\n  // If your collection supports uploads, you can upload\n  // a file directly through the Local API by providing\n  // its full, absolute file path.\n  filePath: path.resolve(__dirname, './path-to-image.jpg'),\n\n  // If you are uploading a file and would like to

showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n## Auth Operations\n\nIf a collection has [`Authentication`](../authentication/overview) enabled, additional Local API operations will be\navailable:\n\n### Login\n\n```js\n// result will be formatted as follows:\n// {\n//   token: 'o38jf0q34jfij43f3f...', // JWT used for auth\n//   user: { ... } // the user document that just logged in\n//   exp: 1609619861 // the UNIX timestamp when the JWT will expire\n// }\n\nconst result = await payload.login({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    password: 'rip',\n  },\n  req: req, // pass a Request object to be provided to all hooks\n  res: res, // used to automatically set an HTTP-only auth cookie\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Forgot Password\n\n```js\n// Returned token will allow for a password reset\nconst token = await payload.forgotPassword({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  },\n  req: req, // pass a Request object to be provided to all hooks\n})\n```\n\n### Reset Password\n\n```js\n// Result will be formatted as follows:\n// {\n//   token: 'o38jf0q34jfij43f3f...', // JWT used for auth\n//   user: { ... } // the user document that just logged in\n// }\nconst result = await payload.resetPassword({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    password: req.body.password, // the new password to set\n    token: 'afh3o2jf2p3f...', // the token generated from the forgotPassword operation\n  },\n  req: req, // pass a Request object to be provided to all hooks\n  res: res, // used to automatically set an HTTP-only auth cookie\n})\n```\n\n### Unlock\n\n```js\n// Returned result will be a boolean representing success or failure\nconst result = await payload.unlock({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  },\n  req: req, // pass a Request object to be provided to all hooks\n  overrideAccess: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Verify\n\n```js\n// Returned result will be a boolean representing success or failure\nconst result = await payload.verifyEmail({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  token: 'afh3o2jf2p3f...', // the token saved on the user as `_verificationToken`\n})\n```\n\n## Globals\n\nThe following Global operations are available through the Local API:\n\n### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be the Header Global.\nconst result = await payload.findGlobal({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Update\n\n```js\n// Result will be the updated Header Global.\nconst result = await payload.updateGlobal({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    nav: [\n      {\n        url: 'https://google.com',\n      },\n      {\n        url: 'https://payloadcms.com',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nLocal API calls will automatically infer your [generated types](../typescript/generating-types).\n\nHere is an example of usage:\n\n```ts\n// Properly inferred as `Post` type\nconst post = await payload.create({\n  collection: 'posts',\n\n  // Data will now be typed as Post and give you type hints\n  data: {\n    title: 'my title',\n    description: 'my description',\n  },\n})\n```\n",

If you want to use Payload within your own projects, make sure you are writing your scripts in ESM format or dynamically importing the Payload config.\n</Banner>\n\n## Importing the Payload config outside of Next.js\n\nYour Payload config likely has imports which need to be handled properly, such as CSS imports and similar. If you were to try and import your config without any Node support for SCSS / CSS files, you'll see errors that arise accordingly. \n\nThis is especially relevant if you are importing your Payload config outside of a bundler context, such as in standalone Node scripts.\n\nFor these cases, you can use Payload's `importConfig` function to handle importing your config safely. It will handle everything you need to be able to load and use your Payload config, without any client-side files present.\n\nHere's an example of a seed script that creates a few documents for local development / testing purposes, using Payload's `importConfig` function to safely import Payload, and the `getPayload` function to retrieve an initialized copy of Payload.\n\n```ts\n// We are importing `getPayload` because we don't need HMR\n// for a standalone script. For usage of Payload inside Next.js,\n// you should always use `import { getPayloadHMR } from '@payloadcms/next/utilities'` instead.\nimport { getPayload } from 'payload'\n\n// This is a helper function that will make sure we can safely load the Payload config\n// and all of its client-side files, such as CSS, SCSS, etc.\nimport { importConfig } from 'payload/node'\n\nimport path from 'path'\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv'\n\n// In ESM, you can create the \"dirname\" variable\n// like this. We'll use this with `dotenv` to load our `.env` file, if necessary.\nconst filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)\nconst dirname = path.dirname(filename)\n\n// If you don't need to load your .env file, \n// then you can skip this part!\ndotenv.config({\n  path: path.resolve(dirname, '../.env'),\n})\n\nconst seed = async () => {\n  // Get a local copy of Payload by passing your config\n  const payload = await getPayload({ config })\n\n  const user = await payload.create({\n    collection: 'users',\n    data: {\n      email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n      password: 'some-password'\n    }\n  })\n\n  const page = await payload.create({\n    collection: 'pages',\n    data: {\n      title: 'My Homepage',\n      // other data to seed here\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n// Call the function here to run your seed script\nseed()\n\n```\n",

Each API takes the same syntax and fully supports all options.\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>\n    Here, \"querying\" relates to filtering or searching through documents within a Collection.\n  </strong>\n  You can build queries to pass to Find operations as well as to [restrict which documents certain\n  users can [access](../access-control/overview) via access control functions.\n</Banner>\n\n## Simple queries\n\nFor example, say you have a collection as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Post: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'posts',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'color',\n      type: 'select',\n      options: ['mint', 'dark-gray', 'white'],\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'featured',\n      type: 'checkbox',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou may eventually have a lot of documents within this Collection. If you wanted to find only documents with `color` equal to `mint`, you could write a query as follows:\n\n```js\nconst query = {\n  color: {\n    // property name to filter on\n    equals: 'mint', // operator to use and value to compare against\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe above example demonstrates a simple query but you can get much more complex.\n\n## Operators\n\n| Operator             | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `equals`             | The value must be exactly equal.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `not_equals`         | The query will return all documents where the value is not equal.                                                                                                                 |\n| `greater_than`       | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `greater_than_equal` | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `less_than`          | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `less_than_equal`    | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `like`               | Case-insensitive string must be present.

Let's take the above `Post` collection for example and write a more complex query using AND / OR:\n\n```js\nconst query = {\n  or: [\n    // array of OR conditions\n    {\n      color: {\n        equals: 'mint',\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      and: [\n        // nested array of AND conditions\n        {\n          color: {\n            equals: 'white',\n          },\n        },\n        {\n          featured: {\n            equals: false,\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nWritten in plain English, if the above query were passed to a `find` operation, it would translate to finding posts where either the `color` is `mint` OR the `color` is `white` AND `featured` is set to false.\n\n## Nested properties\n\nWhen working with nested properties, which can happen when using relational fields, it is possible to use the dot notation to access the nested property. For example, when working with a `Song` collection that has a `artists` field which is related to an `Artists` collection using the `name: 'artists'`. You can access a property within the collection `Artists` like so:\n\n```js\nconst query = {\n  'artists.featured': {\n    // nested property name to filter on\n    exists: true, // operator to use and boolean value that needs to be true\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## GraphQL Find Queries\n\nAll GraphQL `find` queries support the `where` argument, which accepts queries exactly as detailed above.\n\n**For example:**\n\n```\nquery {\n  Posts(where: { color: { equals: mint } }) {\n    docs {\n      color\n    }\n    totalDocs\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## REST Queries\n\nWith the REST API, you can use the full power of Payload queries as well but they become a bit more unwieldy the more complex that they get.\n\nSimple queries are fairly straightforward to write. To understand the syntax, you need to understand that complex URL search strings are parsed into a JSON object. For example, the above [simple query](#simple-queries) would be parsed into a string like this:\n\n**`https://localhost:3000/api/posts?where[color][equals]=mint`**\n\nThis one isn't too bad, but more complex queries get unavoidably more difficult to write as query strings. For this reason, we recommend to use the extremely helpful and ubiquitous [`qs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) package to parse your JSON / object-formatted queries into query strings for use with the REST API.\n\n**For example, using fetch:**\n\n```js\nimport { stringify } from 'qs-esm'\n\nconst query = {\n  color: {\n    equals: 'mint',\n  },\n  // This query could be much more complex\n  // and QS would handle it beautifully\n}\n\nconst getPosts = async () => {\n  const stringifiedQuery = stringify(\n    {\n      where: query, // ensure that `qs` adds the `where` property, too!\n    },\n    { addQueryPrefix: true },\n  )\n\n  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/posts${stringifiedQuery}`)\n  // Continue to handle the response below...\n}\n```\n\n## Local API Queries\n\nThe Local API's `find` operation accepts an object exactly how you write it. For example:\n\n```js\nconst getPosts = async () => {\n  const posts = await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n    where: {\n      color: {\n        equals: 'mint',\n      },\n    },\n  })\n\n  return posts\n}\n```\n\n## Sort\n\nPayload `find` queries support a `sort` parameter through all APIs. Pass the `name` of a top-level field to sort by that field in ascending order. Prefix the name of the field with a minus symbol (\"-\") to sort in descending order. Because sorting is handled by the database, the field you wish to sort on must be stored in the database to work; not a [virtual field](https://payloadcms.com/blog/learn-how-virtual-fields-can-help-solve-common-cms-challenges). It is recommended to enable indexing for the fields where sorting is used.\n\n**REST example:**\n**`https://localhost:3000/api/posts?sort=-createdAt`**\n\n**GraphQL example:**\n\n```\nquery {\n  Posts(sort: \"-createdAt\") {\n    docs {\n      color\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Local API example:**\n\n```js\nconst getPosts = async () => {\n  const posts = await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n    sort: '-createdAt',\n  })\n\n  return posts\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  So you've developed a Payload app, it's fully tested, and running great locally. Now it's time to\n  launch. <strong>Awesome! Great work!</strong> Now, what's next?\n</Banner>\n\nThere are many ways to deploy Payload to a production environment. When evaluating how you will deploy Payload, you need\nto consider these main aspects:\n\n1. [Basics](#basics)\n1. [Security](#security)\n1. [Your database](#database)\n1. [Permanent File Storage](#file-storage)\n1. [Docker](#docker)\n\nPayload can be deployed _anywhere that Next.js can run_ - including Vercel, Netlify, SST, DigitalOcean, AWS, and more. Because it's open source, you can self-host it.\n\nBut it's important to remember that most Payload projects will also need a database, file storage, an email provider, and a CDN. Make sure you have all of the requirements that your project needs, no matter what deployment platform you choose.\n\nOften, the easiest and fastest way to deploy Payload is to use [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new) — where you get everything you need out of the box, including:\n\n1. A MongoDB Atlas database\n1. S3 file storage\n1. Resend email service\n1. Cloudflare CDN\n1. Blue / green deployments\n1. Logs\n1. And more\n\n## Basics\n\nPayload runs fully in Next.js, so the [Next.js build process](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) is used for building Payload. If you've used `create-payload-app` to create your project, executing the `build`\nnpm script will build Payload for production.\n\n## Security\n\nPayload features a suite of security features that you can rely on to strengthen your application's security. When\ndeploying to Production, it's a good idea to double-check that you are making proper use of each of them.\n\n### The Secret Key\n\nWhen you initialize Payload, you provide it with a `secret` property. This property should be impossible to guess and\nextremely difficult for brute-force attacks to crack. Make sure your Production `secret` is a long, complex string. \n\n### Double-check and thoroughly test all Access Control\n\nBecause _**you**_ are in complete control of who can do what with your data, you should double and triple-check that you\nwield that power responsibly before deploying to Production.\n\n<Banner type=\"error\">\n  <strong>\n    By default, all Access Control functions require that a user is successfully logged in to\n    Payload to create, read, update, or delete data.\n  </strong>\n  But, if you allow public user registration, for example, you will want to make sure that your\n  access control functions are more strict - permitting\n  {' '}\n  <strong>\n    only appropriate users\n  </strong>\n  {' '}\n  to perform appropriate actions.\n</Banner>\n\n### Running in Production\n\nDepending on where you deploy Payload, you may need to provide a start script to your deployment platform in order to start up Payload in production mode.\n\nNote that this is different than running `next dev`. Generally, Next.js apps come configured with a `start` script which runs `next start`.\n\n### Secure Cookie Settings\n\nYou should be using an SSL certificate for production Payload instances, which means you\ncan [enable secure cookies](../authentication/config) in your Authentication-enabled Collection configs.\n\n### Preventing API Abuse\n\nPayload comes with a robust set of built-in anti-abuse measures, such as locking out users after X amount of failed\nlogin attempts, GraphQL query complexity limits, max `depth` settings, and\nmore. [Click here to learn more](../production/preventing-abuse).\n\n## Database\n\nPayload can be used with any Postgres database or MongoDB-compatible database including AWS DocumentDB or Azure Cosmos DB. Make sure your production environment has access to the database that Payload uses. \n\nOut of the box, Payload templates pass the `process.env.DATABASE_URI` environment variable to its database adapters, so make sure you've got that environment variable (and all others that you use) assigned in your deployment platform.\n\n### DocumentDB\n\nWhen using AWS DocumentDB, you will need to configure connection options for authentication in the `connectOptions`\npassed to the `mongooseAdapter` . You also need to set `connectOptions.useFacet` to `false` to disable use of the\nunsupported `$facet` aggregation.\n\n### CosmosDB\n\nWhen using Azure Cosmos DB, an index is needed for any field you may want to sort on. To add the sort index for all\nfields that may be sorted in the admin UI use the <a href=\"../configuration/overview\">indexSortableFields</a>\nconfiguration option.\n\n## File storage\n\nIf you are using Payload to [manage file uploads](../upload/overview), you need to consider where your uploaded files\nwill be permanently stored. If you do not use Payload for file uploads, then this section does not impact your app\nwhatsoever.\n\n### Persistent vs Ephemeral Filesystems\n\nSome cloud app hosts such as [Heroku](https://heroku.com) use `ephemeral` file systems, which means that any files\nuploaded to your server only last until the server restarts or shuts down. Heroku and similar providers schedule\nrestarts and shutdowns without your control, meaning your uploads will accidentally disappear without any way to get\nthem back.\n\nAlternatively, persistent filesystems will never delete your files and can be trusted to reliably host uploads\nperpetually.\n\n**Popular cloud providers with ephemeral filesystems:**\n\n- Heroku\n- DigitalOcean Apps\n\n**Popular cloud providers with persistent filesystems:**\n\n- DigitalOcean Droplets\n- Amazon EC2\n- GoDaddy\n- Many other more traditional web hosts\n\n<Banner type=\"error\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you rely on Payload's <strong>Upload</strong> functionality, make sure you either use a host\n  with a persistent filesystem or have an integration with a third-party file host like Amazon S3.\n</Banner>\n\n### Using cloud storage providers\n\nIf you don't use Payload's `upload` functionality, you can completely disregard this section.\n\nBut, if you do, and you still want to use an ephemeral filesystem provider, you can use one of Payload's official cloud storage plugins or write your own to save the files your users upload to a more permanent storage solution like Amazon S3 or DigitalOcean Spaces.\n\nPayload provides a list of official cloud storage adapters for you to use:\n\n- [Azure Blob Storage](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/packages/storage-azure)\n- [Google Cloud Storage](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/packages/storage-gcs)\n- [AWS S3](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/packages/storage-s3)\n- [Uploadthing](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/packages/storage-uploadthing)\n- [Vercel Blob Storage](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/packages/storage-vercel-blob)\n\nFollow the docs to configure any one of these storage providers. For local development, it might be handy to simply store uploads on your own computer, and then when it comes to production, simply enable the plugin for the cloud storage vendor of your choice.\n\n## Docker\n\nThis is an example of a multi-stage docker build of Payload for production. Ensure you are setting your environment\nvariables on deployment, like `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH`, and `DATABASE_URI` if needed.\n\n```dockerfile\n# From https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker/Dockerfile\n\nFROM node:18-alpine AS base\n\n# Install dependencies only when needed\nFROM base AS deps\n# Check https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3#nodealpine to understand why libc6-compat might be needed.\nRUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager\nCOPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* ./\nRUN \\\n  if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn --frozen-lockfile; \\\n  elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; \\\n  elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then corepack enable pnpm && pnpm i --frozen-lockfile; \\\n  else echo \"Lockfile not found.\" && exit 1; \\\n  fi\n\n\n# Rebuild the source code only when needed\nFROM base AS builder\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules\nCOPY . .\n\n# Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.\n# Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry\n# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during the build.\n# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1\n\nRUN \\\n  if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn run build; \\\n  elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm run build; \\\n  elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then corepack enable pnpm && pnpm run build; \\\n  else echo \"Lockfile not found.\" && exit 1; \\\n  fi\n\n# Production image, copy all the files and run next\nFROM base AS runner\nWORKDIR /app\n\nENV NODE_ENV production\n# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during runtime.\n# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1\n\nRUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs\nRUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs\n\nCOPY --from=builder /app/public ./public\n\n# Set the correct permission for prerender cache\nRUN mkdir .next\nRUN chown nextjs:nodejs .next\n\n# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size\n# https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static\n\nUSER nextjs\n\nEXPOSE 3000\n\nENV PORT 3000\n\n# server.js is created by next build from the standalone output\n# https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output\nCMD HOSTNAME=\"0.0.0.0\" node server.js\n```\n\n## Docker Compose\n\nHere is an example of a docker-compose.yml file that can be used for development\n\n```yml\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n  payload:\n    image: node:18-alpine\n    ports:\n      - '3000:3000'\n    volumes:\n      - .:/home/node/app\n      - node_modules:/home/node/app/node_modules\n    working_dir: /home/node/app/\n    command: sh -c \"corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate && pnpm install && pnpm dev\"\n    depends_on:\n      - mongo\n      # - postgres\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\n  # Ensure your DATABASE_URI uses 'mongo' as the hostname ie. mongodb://mongo/my-db-name\n  mongo:\n    image: mongo:latest\n    ports:\n      - '27017:27017'\n    command:\n      - --storageEngine=wiredTiger\n    volumes:\n      - data:/data/db\n    logging:\n      driver: none\n\n  # Uncomment the following to use postgres\n  # postgres:\n  #   restart: always\n  #   image: postgres:latest\n  #   volumes:\n  #     - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n  #   ports:\n  #     - \"5432:5432\"\n\nvolumes:\n  data:\n  # pgdata:\n  node_modules:\n```\n",

        "content": "\n## Introduction\n\nPayload has built-in security best practices that can be configured to your application-specific needs.\n\n## Limit Failed Login Attempts\n\nSet the max number of failed login attempts before a user account is locked out for a period of time. Set the `maxLoginAttempts` on the collections that feature Authentication to a reasonable but low number for your users to get in. Use the `lockTime` to set a number in milliseconds from the time a user fails their last allowed attempt that a user must wait to try again.\n\n## Max Depth\n\nQuerying a collection and automatically including related documents via `depth` incurs a performance cost. Also, it's possible that your configs may have circular relationships, meaning scenarios where an infinite amount of relationships might populate back and forth until your server times out and crashes. You can prevent any potential of depth-related issues by setting a `maxDepth` property on your Payload config.. The maximum allowed depth should be as small as possible without interrupting dev experience, and it defaults to `10`.\n\n## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\nCSRF prevention will verify the authenticity of each request to your API to prevent a malicious action from another site from authorized users. See how to configure CSRF [here](../authentication/overview#csrf-protection).\n\n## Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\n\nTo securely allow headless operation you will need to configure the allowed origins for requests to be able to use the Payload API. You can see how to set CORS as well as other payload configuration settings [here](../configuration/overview)\n\n## Limiting GraphQL Complexity\n\nBecause GraphQL gives the power of query writing outside a server's control, someone with bad intentions might write a maliciously complex query and bog down your server. To prevent resource-intensive GraphQL requests, Payload provides a way specify complexity limits which are based on a complexity score that is calculated for each request.\n\nAny GraphQL request that is calculated to be too expensive is rejected. On the Payload config, in `graphQL` you can set the `maxComplexity` value as an integer. For reference, the default complexity value for each added field is 1, and all `relationship` and `upload` fields are assigned a value of 10.\n\nIf you do not need GraphQL it is advised that you disable it altogether with the Payload config by setting `graphQL.disable: true`. Should you wish to enable GraphQL again, you can remove this property or set it `false`, any time. By turning it off, Payload will bypass creating schemas from your collections and will not register the route.\n\n## Malicious File Uploads\n\nPayload does not execute uploaded files on the server, but depending on your setup it may be used to transmit and store potentially dangerous files. If your configuration allows file uploads there is the potential that a bad actor uploads a malicious file that is then served to other users. Consider the following ways to mitigate the risks.\n\nFirst, enable email [verification](../authentication/config#email-verification) when users are allowed to register new accounts and add other bot prevention services.\n\nReview that `create` and `update` access on file upload collections are as restrictive as your application needs allow. Consider limiting `read` access of uploaded user's files and how you might limit user uploaded files from being served outside of Payload.\n\nYou can also add a [3rd party library](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav) to scan files in a [hook](../hooks/collections) or have antivirus software in place.\n",

        "content": "\n## Introduction\n\nPayload has a few email adapters that can be imported to enable email functionality. The [@payloadcms/email-nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/email-nodemailer) package will be the package most will want to install. This package provides an easy way to use [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com) for email and won't get in your way for those already familiar.\n\nThe email adapter should be passed into the `email` property of the Payload config. This will allow Payload to send emails for things like password resets, new user verification, and any other email sending needs you may have.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Default Configuration\n\nWhen email is not needed or desired, Payload will log a warning on startup notifying that email is not configured. A  warning message will also be logged on any attempt to send an email.\n\n### Email Adapter\n\nAn email adapter will require at least the following fields:\n\n| Option                      | Description                                                                      |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`defaultFromName`** \\*    | The name part of the From field that will be seen on the delivered email         |\n| **`defaultFromAddress`** \\* | The email address part of the From field that will be used when delivering email |\n\n\n### Official Email Adapters\n\n| Name       | Package                                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Nodemailer | [@payloadcms/email-nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/email-nodemailer) | Use any [Nodemailer transport](https://nodemailer.com/transports), including SMTP, Resend, SendGrid, and more. This was provided by default in Payload 2.x. This is the easiest migration path. |\n| Resend     | [@payloadcms/email-resend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/email-resend)         | Resend email via their REST API. This is preferred for serverless platforms such as Vercel because it is much more lightweight than the nodemailer adapter.                                     |\n\n## Nodemailer Configuration\n\n| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`transport`**        | The Nodemailer transport object for when you want to do it yourself, not needed when transportOptions is set                                                                           |\n| **`transportOptions`** | An object that configures the transporter that Payload will create. For all the available options see the [Nodemailer documentation](https://nodemailer.com) or see the examples below |\n\n## Use SMTP\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) options can be passed in using the `transportOptions` object on the `email` options. See the [Nodemailer SMTP documentation](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/) for more information, including details on when `secure` should and should not be set to `true`.\n\n**Example email options using SMTP:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { nodemailerAdapter } from '@payloadcms/email-nodemailer'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  email: nodemailerAdapter({\n    defaultFromAddress: 'info@payloadcms.com',\n    defaultFromName: 'Payload',\n    // Nodemailer transportOptions\n    transportOptions: {\n      host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,\n      port: 587,\n      auth: {\n        user: process.env.SMTP_USER,\n        pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,\n      },\n    },\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n**Example email options using nodemailer.createTransport:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { nodemailerAdapter } from '@payloadcms/email-nodemailer'\nimport nodemailer from 'nodemailer'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  email: nodemailerAdapter({\n    defaultFromAddress: 'info@payloadcms.com',\n    defaultFromName: 'Payload',\n    // Any Nodemailer transport can be used\n    transport: nodemailer.createTransport({\n      host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,\n      port: 587,\n      auth: {\n        user: process.env.SMTP_USER,\n        pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,\n      },\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n**Custom Transport:**\n\nYou also have the ability to bring your own nodemailer transport. This is an example of using the SendGrid nodemailer transport.\n\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { nodemailerAdapter } from '@payloadcms/email-nodemailer'\nimport nodemailerSendgrid from 'nodemailer-sendgrid'\n\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  email: nodemailerAdapter({\n    defaultFromAddress: 'info@payloadcms.com',\n    defaultFromName: 'Payload',\n    transportOptions: nodemailerSendgrid({\n      apiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nDuring development, if you pass nothing to `nodemailerAdapter`, it will use the [ethereal.email](https://ethereal.email) service.\n\nThis will log the ethereal.email details to console on startup.\n\n```ts\nimport { nodemailerAdapter } from '@payloadcms/email-nodemailer'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  email: nodemailerAdapter(),\n})\n```\n\n## Resend Configuration\n\nThe Resend adapter requires an API key to be passed in the options. This can be found in the Resend dashboard. This is the preferred package if you are deploying on Vercel because this is much more lightweight than the Nodemailer adapter.\n\n| Option | Description                         |\n| ------ | ----------------------------------- |\n| apiKey | The API key for the Resend service. |\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { resendAdapter } from '@payloadcms/email-resend'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  email: resendAdapter({\n    defaultFromAddress: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    defaultFromName: 'Payload CMS',\n    apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY || '',\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n## Sending Mail\n\nWith a working transport you can call it anywhere you have access to payload by calling `payload.sendEmail(message)`. The `message` will contain the `to`, `subject` and `html` or `text` for the email being sent. Other options are also available and can be seen in the sendEmail args. Support for these will depend on the adapter being used.\n\n```ts\n// Example of sending an email\nconst email = await payload.sendEmail({\n  to: 'test@example.com',\n  subject: 'This is a test email',\n  text: 'This is my message body',\n})\n```\n\n## Using multiple mail providers\n\nPayload supports the use of a single transporter of email, but there is nothing stopping you from having more. Consider a use case where sending bulk email is handled differently than transactional email and could be done using a [hook](../hooks/overview).\n",

Here's an example showing how to declare your types in your `payload.config.ts` file:\n\n```ts\nimport { Config } from './payload-types'\n\ndeclare module 'payload' {\n  export interface GeneratedTypes extends Config {}\n}\n```\n\n## Custom output file path\n\nYou can specify where you want your types to be generated by adding a property to your Payload config:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n\ttypescript: {\n    // defaults to: path.resolve(__dirname, './payload-types.ts')\n\t\toutputFile: path.resolve(__dirname, './generated-types.ts'),\n\t},\n}\n```\n\nThe above example places your types next to your Payload config itself as the file `generated-types.ts`.\n\n## Custom generated types\n\nPayload generates your types based on a JSON schema. You can extend that JSON schema, and thus the generated types, by passing a function to `typescript.schema`:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  typescript: {\n    schema: [\n      ({ jsonSchema }) => {\n        // Modify the JSON schema here\n        jsonSchema.definitions.Test = {\n          type: 'object',\n          properties: {\n            title: { type: 'string' },\n            content: { type: 'string' },\n          },\n          required: ['title', 'content'],\n        }\n        return jsonSchema\n      },\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n// This will generate the following type in your payload-types.ts:\n\nexport interface Test {\n  title: string;\n  content: string;\n  [k: string]: unknown;\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes the existing JSON schema as an argument and returns the modified JSON schema. It can be useful for plugins that wish to generate their own types.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nFor example, let's look at the following simple Payload config:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Config } from 'payload'\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  serverURL: process.env.PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL,\n  admin: {\n    user: 'users',\n  },\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'users',\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'name',\n          type: 'text',\n          required: true,\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      slug: 'posts',\n      admin: {\n        useAsTitle: 'title',\n      },\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'title',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n        {\n          name: 'author',\n          type: 'relationship',\n          relationTo: 'users',\n        },\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBy generating types, we'll end up with a file containing the following two TypeScript interfaces:\n\n```ts\nexport interface User {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  email?: string\n  resetPasswordToken?: string\n  resetPasswordExpiration?: string\n  loginAttempts?: number\n  lockUntil?: string\n}\n\nexport interface Post {\n  id: string\n  title?: string\n  author?: string | User\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Field Interfaces\n\nFor `array`, `block`, `group` and named `tab` fields, you can generate top level reusable interfaces. The following group field config:\n\n```ts\n{\n  type: 'group',\n  name: 'meta',\n  interfaceName: 'SharedMeta', <-- here!!\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'description',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nwill generate:\n\n```ts\n// a top level reusable interface!!\nexport interface SharedMeta {\n  title?: string\n  description?: string\n}\n\n// example usage inside collection interface\nexport interface Collection1 {\n  // ...other fields\n  meta?: SharedMeta\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Naming Collisions</strong>\n  <br />\n  Since these types are hoisted to the top level, you need to be aware that naming collisions can\n  occur. For example, if you have a collection with the name of `Meta` and you also create a\n  interface with the name `Meta` they will collide. It is recommended to scope your interfaces by\n  appending the field type to the end, i.e. `MetaGroup` or similar.\n</Banner>\n\n## Using your types\n\nNow that your types have been generated, payloads local API will now be typed. It is common for users to want to use this in their frontend code, we recommend generating them with payload and then copying the file over to your frontend codebase. This is the simplest way to get your types into your frontend codebase.\n\n### Adding an NPM script\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important</strong>\n  <br />\n  Payload needs to be able to find your config to generate your types.\n</Banner>\n\nPayload will automatically try and locate your config, but might not always be able to find it. For example, if you are working in a `/src` directory or similar, you need to tell Payload where to find your config manually by using an environment variable. If this applies to you, you can create an NPM script to make generating your types easier.\n\nTo add an NPM script to generate your types and show Payload where to find your config, open your `package.json` and update the `scripts` property to the following:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"generate:types\": \"PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload generate:types\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nNow you can run `yarn generate:types` to easily generate your types.\n",

This pattern allows developers to easily inject custom—sometimes complex—functionality into Payload apps from a very small touch-point.\n\nThere are many [Official Plugins](#official-plugins) available that solve for some of the most common uses cases, such as the [Form Builder Plugin](./seo) or [SEO Plugin](./seo). There are also [Community Plugins](#community-plugins) available, maintained entirely by contributing members. To extend Payload's functionality in some other way, you can easily [build your own plugin](./build-your-own).\n\nWriting plugins is no more complex than writing regular JavaScript. If you know the basic concept of [callback functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function) or how [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) works, and are up to speed with Payload concepts, then writing a plugin will be a breeze.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Because we rely on a simple config-based structure, Payload Plugins simply take in an\n  existing config and returns a _modified_ config with new fields, hooks, collections, admin views, or\n  anything else you can think of.\n</Banner>\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n- Automatically sync data from a specific collection to HubSpot or a similar CRM when data is added or changes\n- Add password-protection functionality to certain documents\n- Add a full e-commerce backend to any Payload app\n- Add custom reporting views to Payload's admin panel\n- Encrypt specific collections' data\n- Add a full form builder implementation\n- Integrate all `upload`-enabled collections with a third-party file host like S3 or Cloudinary\n- Add custom endpoints or GraphQL queries / mutations with any type of custom functionality that you can think of\n\n## Official Plugins\n\nPayload maintains a set of Official Plugins that solve for some of the common use cases. These plugins are maintained by the Payload team and its contributors and are guaranteed to be stable and up-to-date.\n\n- [Form Builder](./form-builder)\n- [Nested Docs](./nested-docs)\n- [Redirects](./redirects)\n- [Search](./search)\n- [Sentry](./sentry)\n- [SEO](./seo)\n- [Stripe](./stripe)\n\nYou can also [build your own plugin](./build-your-own) to easily extend Payload's functionality in some other way.

After all plugins are executed, the full config with all plugins will be sanitized.\n</Banner>\n\nHere is an example what the `addLastModified` plugin from above might look like. It adds a `lastModifiedBy` field to all Payload collections.

Instead of hard-coding a new form into your website or application every time you need one, admins can simply define the schema for each form they need on-the-fly, and your front-end can map over this schema, render its own UI components, and match your brand's design system.\n\nAll form submissions are stored directly in your database and are managed directly from the admin panel. When forms are submitted, you can display a custom on-screen confirmation message to the user or redirect them to a dedicated confirmation page. You can even send dynamic, personalized emails derived from the form's data. For example, you may want to send a confirmation email to the user who submitted the form, and also send a notification email to your team.\n\nForms can be as simple or complex as you need, from a basic contact form, to a multi-step lead generation engine, or even a donation form that processes payment. You may not need to reach for third-party services like HubSpot or Mailchimp for this, but instead use your own first-party tooling, built directly into your own application.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found\n  here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-form-builder).

To override default settings, pass either a boolean value or a partial [Payload Block](../fields/blocks#block-configs) _keyed to the block's slug_. See [Fields](#fields) for more details.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  fields: {\n    text: true,\n    textarea: true,\n    select: true,\n    email: true,\n    state: true,\n    country: true,\n    checkbox: true,\n    number: true,\n    message: true,\n    payment: false,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### `redirectRelationships`\n\nThe `redirectRelationships` property is an array of collection slugs that, when enabled, are populated as options in the form's `redirect` field. This field is used to redirect the user to a dedicated confirmation page upon form submission (optional).\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  redirectRelationships: ['pages'],\n})\n```\n\n### `beforeEmail`\n\nThe `beforeEmail` property is a [beforeChange](<[beforeChange](../hooks/globals#beforechange)>) hook that is called just after emails are prepared, but before they are sent. This is a great place to inject your own HTML template to add custom styles.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  beforeEmail: (emailsToSend) => {\n    // modify the emails in any way before they are sent\n    return emails.map((email) => ({\n      ...email,\n      html: email.html, // transform the html in any way you'd like (maybe wrap it in an html template?)\n    }))\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### `formOverrides`\n\nOverride anything on the `forms` collection by sending a [Payload Collection Config](../configuration/collections) to the `formOverrides` property.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  formOverrides: {\n    slug: 'contact-forms',\n    access: {\n      read: () => true,\n      update: () => false,\n    },\n    fields: [\n      {\n        name: 'custom-field',\n        type: 'text',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### `formSubmissionOverrides`\n\nOverride anything on the `form-submissions` collection by sending a [Payload Collection Config](../configuration/collections) to the `formSubmissionOverrides` property.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  By default, this plugin relies on [Payload access\n  control](../access-control/collections) to restrict the `update` and\n  `read` operations on the `form-submissions` collection. This is because _anyone_ should be able to\n  create a form submission, even from a public-facing website, but _no one_ should be able to update\n  a submission one it has been created, or read a submission unless they have permission. You can\n  override this behavior or any other property as needed.\n</Banner>\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  formSubmissionOverrides: {\n    slug: 'leads',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### `handlePayment`\n\nThe `handlePayment` property is a [beforeChange](<[beforeChange](../hooks/globals#beforechange)>) hook that is called upon form submission. You can integrate into any third-party payment processing API here to accept payment based on form input. You can use the `getPaymentTotal` function to calculate the total cost after all conditions have been applied. This is only applicable if the form has enabled the `payment` field.\n\nFirst import the utility function. This will execute all of the price conditions that you have set in your form's `payment` field and returns the total price.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nimport { getPaymentTotal } from '@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder'\n```\n\nThen in your plugin's config:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  handlePayment: async ({ form, submissionData }) => {\n    // first calculate the price\n    const paymentField = form.fields?.find((field) => field.blockType === 'payment')\n    const price = getPaymentTotal({\n      basePrice: paymentField.basePrice,\n      priceConditions: paymentField.priceConditions,\n      fieldValues: submissionData,\n    })\n    // then asynchronously process the payment here\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Fields\n\nEach field represents a form input. To override default settings pass either a boolean value or a partial [Payload Block](../fields/blocks) _keyed to the block's slug_.

Upon submission, the `handlePayment` callback is executed with the form and submission data. You can use this to integrate with any third-party payment processing API.\n\n| property          | type     | description                                                                       |\n| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`            | string   | The name of the field.                                                            |\n| `label`           | string   | The label of the field.                                                           |\n| `defaultValue`    | number   | The default value of the field.                                                   |\n| `width`           | string   | The width of the field on the front-end.                                          |\n| `required`        | checkbox | Whether or not the field is required when submitted.                              |\n| `priceConditions` | array    | An array of objects that define the price conditions. See below for more details. |\n\n#### Price Conditions\n\nEach of the `priceConditions` are executed by the `getPaymentTotal` utility that this plugin provides. You can call this function in your `handlePayment` callback to dynamically calculate the total price of a form upon submission based on the user's input. For example, you could create a price condition that says \"if the user selects 'yes' for this checkbox, add $10 to the total price\".\n\n| property           | type         | description                                      |\n| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| `fieldToUse`       | relationship | The field to use to determine the price.         |\n| `condition`        | string       | The condition to use to determine the price.     |\n| `valueForOperator` | string       | The value to use for the operator.               |\n| `operator`         | string       | The operator to use to determine the price.      |\n| `valueType`        | string       | The type of value to use to determine the price. |\n| `value`            | string       | The value to use to determine the price.         |\n\n### Field Overrides\n\nYou can provide your own custom fields by passing a new [Payload Block](../fields/blocks#block-configs) object into `fields`. You can override or extend any existing fields by first importing the `fields` from the plugin:\n\n```ts\nimport { fields } from '@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder'\n```\n\nThen merging it into your own custom field:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  fields: {\n    text: {\n      ...fields.text,\n      labels: {\n        singular: 'Custom Text Field',\n        plural: 'Custom Text Fields',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Email\n\nThis plugin relies on the [email configuration](../email/overview) defined in your `payload.init()`. It will read from your config and attempt to send your emails using the credentials provided.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```js\nimport {\n  PluginConfig,\n  Form,\n  FormSubmission,\n  FieldsConfig,\n  BeforePayment,\n  BeforeEmail,\n  HandlePayment,\n  ...\n} from \"@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/types\";\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Examples Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples) contains an official [Form Builder Plugin Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/form-builder) which demonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end. We've also included an in-depth walk-through of how to build a form from scratch in our [Form Builder Plugin Blog Post](https://payloadcms.com/blog/create-custom-forms-with-the-official-form-builder-plugin).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBelow are some common troubleshooting tips. To help other developers, please contribute to this section as you troubleshoot your own application.\n\n#### SendGrid 403 Forbidden Error\n\n- If you are using [SendGrid Link Branding](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding) to remove the \"via sendgrid.net\" part of your email, you must also setup [Domain Authentication](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication). This means you can only send emails from an address on this domain — so the `from` addresses in your form submission emails **_cannot_** be anything other than `something@your_domain.com`. This means that from `{{email}}` will not work, but `website@your_domain.com` will. You can still send the form's email address in the body of the email.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot 1](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-1.jpg?raw=true)\n\n<br />\n![screenshot 2](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-2.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 3](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-3.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 4](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-4.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 5](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-5.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 6](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-6.jpg?raw=true)\n",

It does so by adding a\nnew `parent` field onto each of your documents that, when selected, attaches itself to the parent's tree. When you edit\nthe great-great-grandparent of a document, for instance, all of its descendants are recursively updated. This is an\nextremely powerful way of achieving hierarchy within a collection, such as parent/child relationship between pages.\n\nDocuments also receive a new `breadcrumbs` field. Once a parent is assigned, these breadcrumbs are populated based on\neach ancestor up the tree. Breadcrumbs allow you to dynamically generate labels and URLs based on the document's\nposition in the hierarchy. Even if the slug of a parent document changes, or the entire tree is nested another level\ndeep, changes will cascade down the entire tree and all breadcrumbs will reflect those changes.\n\nWith this pattern you can perform whatever side-effects your applications needs on even the most deeply nested\ndocuments. For example, you could easily add a custom `fullTitle` field onto each document and inject the parent's title\nonto it, such as \"Parent Title > Child Title\". This would allow you to then perform searches and filters based on _that_\nfield instead of the original title.

This field is automatically set to either the `collection.admin.useAsTitle` (if defined) or is set to the `ID` of the document. You can also dynamically define the `label` by passing a function to the options property of [`generateLabel`](#generateLabel). |\n| `url`   | The URL of the breadcrumb. By default, this field is undefined. You can manually define this field by passing a property called function to the plugin options property of [`generateURL`](#generateURL).                                                                                    |\n\n### Options\n\n#### `collections`\n\nAn array of collections slugs to enable nested docs.\n\n#### `generateLabel`\n\nEach `breadcrumb` has a required `label` field. By default, its value will be set to the collection's `admin.useAsTitle`\nor fallback the the `ID` of the document.\n\nYou can also pass a function to dynamically set the `label` of your breadcrumb.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nnestedDocs({\n  //...\n  generateLabel: (_, doc) => doc.title, // NOTE: 'title' is a hypothetical field\n})\n```\n\nThe function takes two arguments and returns a string:\n\n| Argument | Type     | Description                                  |\n| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| `docs`   | `Array`  | An array of the breadcrumbs up to that point |\n| `doc`    | `Object` | The current document being edited            |\n\n#### `generateURL`\n\nA function that allows you to dynamically generate each breadcrumb `url`. Each `breadcrumb` has an optional `url` field\nwhich is undefined by default. For example, you might want to format a full URL to contain all breadcrumbs up to\nthat point, like `/about-us/company/our-team`.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nnestedDocs({\n  //...\n  generateURL: (docs) => docs.reduce((url, doc) => `${url}/${doc.slug}`, ''), // NOTE: 'slug' is a hypothetical field\n})\n```\n\n| Argument | Type     | Description                                  |\n| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| `docs`   | `Array`  | An array of the breadcrumbs up to that point |\n| `doc`    | `Object` | The current document being edited            |\n\n#### `parentFieldSlug`\n\nWhen defined, the `parent` field will not be provided for you automatically, and instead, expects you to add your\nown `parent` field to each collection manually. This gives you complete control over where you put the field in your\nadmin dashboard, etc. Set this property to the `name` of your custom field.\n\n#### `breadcrumbsFieldSlug`\n\nWhen defined, the `breadcrumbs` field will not be provided for you, and instead, expects you to add your\nown `breadcrumbs` field to each collection manually. Set this property to the `name` of your custom field.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you opt out of automatically being provided a `parent` or `breadcrumbs` field, you need to make\n  sure that both fields are placed at the top-level of your document. They cannot exist within any\n  nested data structures like a `group`, `array`, or `blocks`.\n</Banner>\n\n## Overrides\n\nYou can also extend the built-in `parent` and `breadcrumbs` fields per collection by using the `createParentField`\nand `createBreadcrumbField` methods. They will merge your customizations overtop the plugin's base field configurations.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\nimport { createParentField } from '@payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs/fields'\nimport { createBreadcrumbsField } from '@payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs/fields'\n\nconst examplePageConfig: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    createParentField(\n      // First argument is equal to the slug of the collection\n      // that the field references\n      'pages',\n\n      // Second argument is equal to field overrides that you specify,\n      // which will be merged into the base parent field config\n      {\n        admin: {\n          position: 'sidebar',\n        },\n        // Note: if you override the `filterOptions` of the `parent` field,\n        // be sure to continue to prevent the document from referencing itself as the parent like this:\n        // filterOptions: ({ id }) => ({ id: {not_equals: id }})`\n      },\n    ),\n    createBreadcrumbsField(\n      // First argument is equal to the slug of the collection\n      // that the field references\n      'pages',\n\n      // Argument equal to field overrides that you specify,\n      // which will be merged into the base `breadcrumbs` field config\n      {\n        label: 'Page Breadcrumbs',\n      },\n    ),\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If overriding the `name` of either `breadcrumbs` or `parent` fields, you must specify the\n  `breadcrumbsFieldSlug` or `parentFieldSlug` respectively.\n</Banner>\n\n## Localization\n\nThis plugin supports localization by default. If the `localization` property is set in your Payload config,\nthe `breadcrumbs` field is automatically localized. For more details on how localization works in Payload, see\nthe [Localization](../localization/overview) docs.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport { PluginConfig, GenerateURL, GenerateLabel } from '@payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs/types'\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Examples Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples) contains an\nofficial [Nested Docs Plugin Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/nested-docs) which\ndemonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end.\nThe [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) also contains an\nofficial [Website Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/website)\nand [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommere), both of which use this\nplugin.\n",

It does so by adding a `redirects` collection to your config that allows you specify a redirect from one URL to another. Your front-end application can use this data to automatically redirect users to the correct page using proper HTTP status codes. This is useful for SEO, indexing, and search engine ranking when re-platforming or when changing your URL structure.\n\nFor example, if you have a page at `/about` and you want to change it to `/about-us`, you can create a redirect from the old page to the new one, then you can use this data to write HTTP redirects into your front-end application. This will ensure that users are redirected to the correct page without penalty because search engines are notified of the change at the request level. This is a very lightweight plugin that will allow you to integrate managed redirects for any front-end framework.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found\n  here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-redirects).

It does so by creating a new `search` collection that is indexed in the database then saving a static copy of each of your documents using only search-critical data. Search records are automatically created, synced, and deleted behind-the-scenes as you manage your application's documents.\n\nFor example, if you have a posts collection that is extremely large and complex, this would allow you to sync just the title, excerpt, and slug of each post so you can query on _that_ instead of the original post directly. Search records are static, so querying them also has the significant advantage of bypassing any hooks that may present be on the original documents. You define exactly what data is synced, and you can even modify or fallback this data before it is saved on a per-document basis.\n\nTo query search results, use all the existing Payload APIs that you are already familiar with. You can also prioritize search results by setting a custom priority for each collection. For example, you may want to list blog posts before pages. Or you may want one specific post to always take appear first. Search records are given a `priority` field that can be used as the `?sort=` parameter in your queries.\n\nThis plugin is a great way to implement a fast, immersive search experience such as a search bar in a front-end application. Many applications may not need the power and complexity of a third-party service like Algolia or ElasticSearch. This plugin provides a first-party alternative that is easy to set up and runs entirely on your own database.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found\n  here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-search). If you need help,\n  check out our [Community Help](https://payloadcms.com/community-help). If you think you've found a\n  bug, please [open a new\n  issue](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=&labels=plugin%3A%20search&template=bug_report.md&title=plugin-search%3A)\n  with as much detail as possible.\n</Banner>\n\n## Core Features\n\n- Automatically adds an indexed `search` collection to your database\n- Automatically creates, syncs, and deletes search records as you manage your documents\n- Saves only search-critical data that you define (e.g. title, excerpt, etc.)\n- Allows you to query search results using first-party Payload APIs\n- Allows you to query documents without triggering any of their underlying hooks\n- Allows you to easily prioritize search results by collection or document\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):\n\n```bash\n  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-search\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](../configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):\n\n```js\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport search from '@payloadcms/plugin-search'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'pages',\n      fields: [],\n    },\n    {\n      slug: 'posts',\n      fields: [],\n    },\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    search({\n      collections: ['pages', 'posts'],\n      defaultPriorities: {\n        pages: 10,\n        posts: 20,\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### `collections`\n\nThe `collections` property is an array of collection slugs to enable syncing to search. Enabled collections receive a `beforeChange` and `afterDelete` hook that creates, updates, and deletes its respective search record as it changes over time.\n\n#### `defaultPriorities`\n\nThis plugin automatically adds a `priority` field to the `search` collection that can be used as the `?sort=` parameter in your queries. For example, you may want to list blog posts before pages. Or you may want one specific post to always take appear first.\n\nThe `defaultPriorities` property is used to set a fallback `priority` on search records during the `create` operation. It accepts an object with keys that are your collection slugs and values that can either be a number or a function that returns a number. The function receives the `doc` as an argument, which is the document being created.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  searchPlugin({\n    defaultPriorities: {\n      pages: ({ doc }) => (doc.title.startsWith('Hello, world!') ? 1 : 10),\n      posts: 20,\n    },\n  }),\n}\n```\n\n#### `searchOverrides`\n\nThis plugin automatically creates the `search` collection, but you can override anything on this collection via the `searchOverrides` property. It accepts anything from the [Payload Collection Config](../configuration/collections) and merges it in with the default `search` collection config provided by the plugin.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  searchPlugin({\n    searchOverrides: {\n      slug: 'search-results',\n    },\n  }),\n}\n```\n\n#### `beforeSync`\n\nBefore creating or updating a search record, the `beforeSync` function runs. This is an [afterChange](<[afterChange](../hooks/globals#afterchange)>) hook that allows you to modify the data or provide fallbacks before its search record is created or updated.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  searchPlugin({\n    beforeSync: ({ originalDoc, searchDoc }) => ({\n      ...searchDoc,\n      // Modify your docs in any way here, this can be async\n      excerpt: originalDoc?.excerpt || 'This is a fallback excerpt',\n    }),\n  }),\n}\n```\n\n#### `syncDrafts`\n\nWhen `syncDrafts` is true, draft documents will be synced to search. This is false by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](../versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.\n\n#### `deleteDrafts`\n\nIf true, will delete documents from search whose status changes to draft. This is true by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](../versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SearchConfig, BeforeSync } from '@payloadcms/plugin-search/types'\n```\n",

When enabled on your collections and globals, it adds a new `meta` field group containing `title`, `description`, and `image` by default. Your front-end application can then use this data to render meta tags however your application requires. For example, you would inject a `title` tag into the `<head>` of your page using `meta.title` as its content.\n\nAs users are editing documents within the admin panel, they have the option to \"auto-generate\" these fields. When clicked, this plugin will execute your own custom functions that re-generate the title, description, and image. This way you can build your own SEO writing assistance directly into your application. For example, you could append your site name onto the page title, or use the document's excerpt field as the description, or even integrate with some third-party API to generate the image using AI.\n\nTo help you visualize what your page might look like in a search engine, a preview is rendered on page just beneath the meta fields. This preview is updated in real-time as you edit your metadata. There are also visual indicators to help you write effective meta, such as a character counter for the title and description fields. You can even inject your own custom fields into the `meta` field group as your application requires, like `og:title` or `json-ld`. If you've ever used something like Yoast SEO, this plugin might feel very familiar.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found\n  here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-seo). If you need help,\n  check out our [Community Help](https://payloadcms.com/community-help). If you think you've found a\n  bug, please [open a new\n  issue](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=&labels=plugin%3A%20seo&template=bug_report.md&title=plugin-seo%3A)\n  with as much detail as possible.\n</Banner>\n\n## Core features\n\n- Adds a `meta` field group to every SEO-enabled collection or global\n- Allows you to define custom functions to auto-generate metadata\n- Displays hints and indicators to help content editor write effective meta\n- Renders a snippet of what a search engine might display\n- Extendable so you can define custom fields like `og:title` or `json-ld`\n- Soon will support dynamic variable injection\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):\n\n```bash\n  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-seo\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](../configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';\nimport seoPlugin from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo';\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'pages',\n      fields: []\n    },\n    {\n      slug: 'media',\n      upload: {\n        staticDir: // path to your static directory,\n      },\n      fields: []\n    }\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    seoPlugin({\n      collections: [\n        'pages',\n      ],\n      uploadsCollection: 'media',\n      generateTitle: ({ doc }) => `Website.com — ${doc.title}`,\n      generateDescription: ({ doc }) => doc.excerpt\n    })\n  ]\n});\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n### Options\n\n##### `collections`\n\nAn array of collections slugs to enable SEO. Enabled collections receive a `meta` field which is an object of title, description, and image subfields.\n\n##### `globals`\n\nAn array of global slugs to enable SEO. Enabled globals receive a `meta` field which is an object of title, description, and image subfields.\n\n##### `fields`\n\nAn array of fields that allows you to inject your own custom fields onto the `meta` field group. The following fields are provided by default:\n\n- `title`: text\n- `description`: textarea\n- `image`: upload (if an `uploadsCollection` is provided)\n- `preview`: ui\n\n##### `uploadsCollection`\n\nSet the `uploadsCollection` to your application's upload-enabled collection slug. This is used to provide an `image` field on the `meta` field group.\n\n##### `tabbedUI`\n\nWhen the `tabbedUI` property is `true`, it appends an `SEO` tab onto your config using Payload's [Tabs Field](../fields/tabs). If your collection is not already tab-enabled, meaning the first field in your config is not of type `tabs`, then one will be created for you called `Content`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  If you wish to continue to use top-level or sidebar fields with `tabbedUI`, you must not let the\n  default `Content` tab get created for you (see the note above). Instead, you must define the first\n  field of your config with type `tabs` and place all other fields adjacent to this one.\n</Banner>\n\n##### `generateTitle`\n\nA function that allows you to return any meta title, including from document's content.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateTitle: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) => `Website.com — ${doc?.title}`,\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### `generateDescription`\n\nA function that allows you to return any meta description, including from document's content.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateDescription: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) => doc?.excerpt,\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### `generateImage`\n\nA function that allows you to return any meta image, including from document's content.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateImage: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) => doc?.featuredImage,\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### `generateURL`\n\nA function called by the search preview component to display the actual URL of your page.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateURL: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) =>\n      `https://yoursite.com/${collection?.slug}/${doc?.slug}`,\n  })\n}\n```\n\n#### `interfaceName`\n\nRename the meta group interface name that is generated for TypeScript and GraphQL.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    interfaceName: 'customInterfaceNameSEO',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n#### `fieldOverrides`\n\nPass any valid field props to the base fields: Title, Description or Image.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nseoPlugin({\n  // ...\n  fieldOverrides: {\n    title: {\n      required: true,\n    },\n    description: {\n      localized: true,\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Direct use of fields\n\nThere is the option to directly import any of the fields from the plugin so that you can include them anywhere as needed.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  You will still need to configure the plugin in the Payload config in order to configure the generation functions.\n  Since these fields are imported and used directly, they don't have access to the plugin config so they may need additional arguments to work the same way.\n</Banner>\n\n```ts\nimport { MetaDescriptionField, MetaImageField, MetaTitleField, OverviewField, PreviewField } from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo/fields'\n\n// Used as fields\nMetaImageField({\n  // the upload collection slug\n  relationTo: 'media',\n\n  // if the `generateImage` function is configured\n  hasGenerateFn: true,\n})\n\nMetaDescriptionField({\n  // if the `generateDescription` function is configured\n  hasGenerateFn: true,\n})\n\nMetaTitleField({\n  // if the `generateTitle` function is configured\n  hasGenerateFn: true,\n})\n\nPreviewField({\n  // if the `generateUrl` function is configured\n  hasGenerateFn: true,\n\n  // field paths to match the target field for data\n  titlePath: 'meta.title',\n  descriptionPath: 'meta.description',\n})\n\nOverviewField({\n  // field paths to match the target field for data\n  titlePath: 'meta.title',\n  descriptionPath: 'meta.description',\n  imagePath: 'meta.image',\n})\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  PluginConfig,\n  GenerateTitle,\n  GenerateDescription\n  GenerateURL\n} from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo/types';\n```\n\nYou can then pass the collections from your generated Payload types into the generation types, for example:\n\n```ts\nimport { Page } from './payload-types.ts';\n\nimport { GenerateTitle } from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo/types';\n\nconst generateTitle: GenerateTitle<Page> = async ({ doc, locale }) => {\n  return `Website.com — ${doc?.title}`\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) contains an official [Website Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/website) and [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommere) which demonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70709113/163850633-f3da5f8e-2527-4688-bc79-17233307a883.png)\n",

        "content": "\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@payloadcms/plugin-stripe)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/plugin-stripe)\n\nWith this plugin you can easily integrate [Stripe](https://stripe.com) into Payload. Simply provide your Stripe credentials and this plugin will open up a two-way communication channel between the two platforms. This enables you to easily sync data back and forth, as well as proxy the Stripe REST API through Payload's access control. Use this plugin to completely offload billing to Stripe and retain full control over your application's data.\n\nFor example, you might be building an e-commerce or SaaS application, where you have a `products` or a `plans` collection that requires either a one-time payment or a subscription. You can to tie each of these products to Stripe, then easily subscribe to billing-related events to perform your application's business logic, such as active purchases or subscription cancellations.\n\nTo build a checkout flow on your front-end you can either use [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout), or you can also build a completely custom checkout experience from scratch using [Stripe Web Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/elements). Then to build fully custom, secure customer dashboards, you can leverage Payload's access control to restrict access to your Stripe resources so your users never have to leave your site to manage their accounts.\n\nThe beauty of this plugin is the entirety of your application's content and business logic can be handled in Payload while Stripe handles solely the billing and payment processing. You can build a completely proprietary application that is endlessly customizable and extendable, on APIs and databases that you own. Hosted services like Shopify or BigCommerce might fracture your application's content then charge you for access.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found\n  here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-stripe).

This flag should only be used for local development, see the security note below for more information.\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`/api/stripe/rest`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  credentials: 'include',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    // Authorization: `JWT ${token}` // NOTE: do this if not in a browser (i.e. curl or Postman)\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    stripeMethod: 'stripe.subscriptions.list',\n    stripeArgs: [\n      {\n        customer: 'abc',\n      },\n    ],\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nIf you need to proxy the API server-side, use the [stripeProxy](#node) function.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The `/api` part of these routes may be different based on the settings defined in your Payload\n  config.\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Opening the REST proxy endpoint in production is a potential security risk. Authenticated users will have open access to the Stripe REST API. In production, open your own endpoint and use the [stripeProxy](#node) function to proxy the Stripe API server-side.\n</Banner>\n\n## Webhooks\n\n[Stripe webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) are used to sync from Stripe to Payload. Webhooks listen for events on your Stripe account so you can trigger reactions to them. Follow the steps below to enable webhooks.\n\nDevelopment:\n\n1. Login using Stripe cli `stripe login`\n1. Forward events to localhost `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/stripe/webhooks`\n1. Paste the given secret into your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET`\n\nProduction:\n\n1. Login and [create a new webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/create) from the Stripe dashboard\n1. Paste `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/api/stripe/webhooks` as the \"Webhook Endpoint URL\"\n1. Select which events to broadcast\n1. Paste the given secret into your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET`\n1. Then, handle these events using the `webhooks` portion of this plugin's config:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport stripePlugin from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    stripePlugin({\n      stripeSecretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,\n      stripeWebhooksEndpointSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET,\n      webhooks: {\n        'customer.subscription.updated': ({ event, stripe, stripeConfig }) => {\n          // do something...\n        },\n      },\n      // NOTE: you can also catch all Stripe webhook events and handle the event types yourself\n      // webhooks: (event, stripe, stripeConfig) => {\n      //   switch (event.type): {\n      //     case 'customer.subscription.updated': {\n      //       // do something...\n      //       break;\n      //     }\n      //     default: {\n      //       break;\n      //     }\n      //   }\n      // }\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\nFor a full list of available webhooks, see [here](https://stripe.com/docs/cli/trigger#trigger-event).\n\n## Node\n\nOn the server you should interface with Stripe directly using the [stripe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe) npm module. That might look something like this:\n\n```ts\nimport Stripe from 'stripe'\n\nconst stripeSecretKey = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\nconst stripe = new Stripe(stripeSecretKey, { apiVersion: '2022-08-01' })\n\nexport const MyFunction = async () => {\n  try {\n    const customer = await stripe.customers.create({\n      email: data.email,\n    })\n\n    // do something...\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error.message)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can interface with the Stripe using the `stripeProxy`, which is exactly what the `/api/stripe/rest` endpoint does behind-the-scenes. Here's the same example as above, but piped through the proxy:\n\n```ts\nimport { stripeProxy } from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe'\n\nexport const MyFunction = async () => {\n  try {\n    const customer = await stripeProxy({\n      stripeSecretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,\n      stripeMethod: 'customers.create',\n      stripeArgs: [\n        {\n          email: data.email,\n        },\n      ],\n    })\n\n    if (customer.status === 200) {\n      // do something...\n    }\n\n    if (customer.status >= 400) {\n      throw new Error(customer.message)\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error.message)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sync\n\nThis option will setup a basic sync between Payload collections and Stripe resources for you automatically. It will create all the necessary hooks and webhooks handlers, so the only thing you have to do is map your Payload fields to their corresponding Stripe properties. As documents are created, updated, and deleted from either Stripe or Payload, the changes are reflected on either side.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you wish to enable a _two-way_ sync, be sure to setup [`webhooks`](#webhooks) and pass the\n  `stripeWebhooksEndpointSecret` through your config.\n</Banner>\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport stripePlugin from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    stripePlugin({\n      stripeSecretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,\n      stripeWebhooksEndpointSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET,\n      sync: [\n        {\n          collection: 'customers',\n          stripeResourceType: 'customers',\n          stripeResourceTypeSingular: 'customer',\n          fields: [\n            {\n              fieldPath: 'name', // this is a field on your own Payload config\n              stripeProperty: 'name', // use dot notation, if applicable\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      ],\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Due to limitations in the Stripe API, this currently only works with top-level fields. This is\n  because every Stripe object is a separate entity, making it difficult to abstract into a simple\n  reusable library. In the future, we may find a pattern around this. But for now, cases like that\n  will need to be hard-coded.\n</Banner>\n\nUsing `sync` will do the following:\n\n- Adds and maintains a `stripeID` read-only field on each collection, this is a field generated _by Stripe_ and used as a cross-reference\n- Adds a direct link to the resource on Stripe.com\n- Adds and maintains an `skipSync` read-only flag on each collection to prevent infinite syncs when hooks trigger webhooks\n- Adds the following hooks to each collection:\n  - `beforeValidate`: `createNewInStripe`\n  - `beforeChange`: `syncExistingWithStripe`\n  - `afterDelete`: `deleteFromStripe`\n- Handles the following Stripe webhooks\n  - `STRIPE_TYPE.created`: `handleCreatedOrUpdated`\n  - `STRIPE_TYPE.updated`: `handleCreatedOrUpdated`\n  - `STRIPE_TYPE.deleted`: `handleDeleted`\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  StripeConfig,\n  StripeWebhookHandler,\n  StripeProxy,\n  ...\n} from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe/types';\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) contains an official [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommerce) which demonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end.

        "content": "\nBuilding your own [Payload Plugin](./overview) is easy, and if you&apos;re already familiar with Payload then you&apos;ll have everything you need to get started. You can either start from scratch or use the [Plugin Template](#plugin-template) to get up and running quickly.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  To use the template, run `npx create-payload-app@latest -t plugin -n my-new-plugin` directly in\n  your terminal or [clone the template directly from\n  GitHub](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload-plugin-template).\n</Banner>\n\nOur plugin template includes everything you need to build a full life-cycle plugin:\n\n- Example files and functions for extending the payload config\n- A local dev environment to develop the plugin\n- Test suite with integrated GitHub workflow\n\nBy abstracting your code into a plugin, you&apos;ll be able to reuse your feature across multiple projects and make it available for other developers to use.\n\n## Plugins Recap\n\nHere is a brief recap of how to integrate plugins with Payload, to learn more head back to the [plugin overview page](../plugins/overview).\n\n### How to install a plugin\n\nTo install any plugin, simply add it to your Payload config in the plugins array.\n\n```\nimport samplePlugin from 'sample-plugin';\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    // Add plugins here\n    samplePlugin({\n\t\tenabled: true,\n    }),\n  ],\n});\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n### Initialization\n\nThe initialization process goes in the following order:\n\n1. Incoming config is validated\n2. Plugins execute\n3. Default options are integrated\n4. Sanitization cleans and validates data\n5. Final config gets initialized\n\n## Plugin Template\n\nIn the [Payload Plugin Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload-plugin-template), you will see a common file structure that is used across plugins:\n\n1. `/` root folder - general configuration\n2. `/src` folder - everything related to the plugin\n3. `/dev` folder - sanitized test project for development\n\n### The root folder\n\nIn the root folder, you will see various files related to the configuration of the plugin. We set up our environment in a similar manner in Payload core and across other projects. The only two files you need to modify are:\n\n- **README**.md - This contains instructions on how to use the template. When you are ready, update this to contain instructions on how to use your Plugin.\n- **package**.json - Contains necessary scripts and dependencies. Overwrite the metadata in this file to describe your Plugin.\n\n### The dev folder\n\nThe purpose of the **dev** folder is to provide a sanitized local Payload project. so you can run and test your plugin while you are actively developing it.\n\nDo **not** store any of the plugin functionality in this folder - it is purely an environment to _assist_ you with developing the plugin.\n\nIf you&apos;re starting from scratch, you can easily setup a dev environment like this:\n\n```\nmkdir dev\ncd dev\nnpx create-payload-app@latest\n```\n\nIf you&apos;re using the plugin template, the dev folder is built out for you and the `samplePlugin` has already been installed in `dev/payload.config()`.\n\n```\n  plugins: [\n    // when you rename the plugin or add options, make sure to update it here\n    samplePlugin({\n      enabled: false,\n    })\n  ]\n```\n\nYou can add to the `dev/payload.config` and build out the dev project as needed to test your plugin.\n\nWhen you&apos;re ready to start development, navigate into this folder with `cd dev`\n\nAnd then start the project with `yarn dev` and pull up `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.\n\n## Testing\n\nAnother benefit of the dev folder is that you have the perfect environment established for testing.\n\nA good test suite is essential to ensure quality and stability in your plugin. Payload typically uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/); a popular testing framework, widely used for testing JavaScript and particularly for applications built with React.\n\nJest organizes tests into test suites and cases. We recommend creating tests based on the expected behavior of your plugin from start to finish. Read more about tests in the [Jest documentation.](https://jestjs.io/)\n\nThe plugin template provides a stubbed out test suite at `dev/plugin.spec.ts` which is ready to go - just add in your own test conditions and you&apos;re all set!\n\n```\nimport payload from 'payload'\n\ndescribe('Plugin tests', () => {\n  // Example test to check for seeded data\n  it('seeds data accordingly', async () => {\n    const newCollectionQuery = await payload.find({\n      collection: 'newCollection',\n      sort: 'createdAt',\n    })\n\n    newCollection = newCollectionQuery.docs\n\n    expect(newCollectionQuery.totalDocs).toEqual(1)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Seeding data\n\nFor development and testing, you will likely need some data to work with. You can streamline this process by seeding and dropping your database - instead of manually entering data.\n\nIn the plugin template, you can navigate to `dev/src/server.ts` and see an example seed function.\n\n```\nif (process.env.PAYLOAD_SEED === 'true') {\n    await seed(payload)\n}\n```\n\nA sample seed function has been created for you at `dev/src/seed`, update this file with additional data as needed.\n\n```\nexport const seed = async (payload: Payload): Promise<void> => {\n  payload.logger.info('Seeding data...')\n\n  await payload.create({\n    collection: 'new-collection',\n    data: {\n      title: 'Seeded title',\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Add additional seed data here\n}\n\n```\n\n## Overview of the src folder\n\nNow that we have our environment setup and dev project ready to go - it&apos;s time to build the plugin!\n\n**index.ts**\n\nFirst up, the `src/index.ts` file - this is where the plugin should be imported from. It is best practice not to build the plugin directly in this file, instead we use this to export the plugin and types from their respective files.\n\n**Plugin.ts**\n\nTo reiterate, the essence of a [Payload Plugin](./overview) is simply to extend the [Payload Config](../configuration/overview) - and that is exactly what we are doing in this file.\n\n```\nexport const samplePlugin =\n  (pluginOptions: PluginTypes) =>\n  (incomingConfig: Config): Config => {\n    let config = { ...incomingConfig }\n\n   // do something cool with the config here\n\n    return config\n }\n```\n\n1. First, you need to receive the existing Payload config along with any plugin options.\n2. Then set the variable `config` to be equal to a copy of the existing config.\n3. From here, you can extend the config however you like!\n4. Finally, return the config and you&apos;re all set.\n\n## Spread Syntax\n\n[Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) (or the spread operator) is a feature in JavaScript that uses the dot notation **(...)** to spread elements from arrays, strings, or objects into various contexts.\n\nWe are going to use spread syntax to allow us to add data to existing arrays without losing the existing data. It is crucial to spread the existing data correctly, else this can cause adverse behavior and conflicts with Payload config and other plugins.\n\nLet&apos;s say you want to build a plugin that adds a new collection:\n\n```\nconfig.collections = [\n  ...(config.collections || []),\n newCollection,\n  // Add additional collections here\n]\n```\n\nFirst, you need to spread the `config.collections` to ensure that we don&apos;t lose the existing collections. Then you can add any additional collections, just as you would in a regular payload config.\n\nThis same logic is applied to other properties like admin, globals, hooks:\n\n```\nconfig.globals = [\n  ...(config.globals || []),\n  // Add additional globals here\n]\n\nconfig.hooks = {\n  ...(config.hooks || {}),\n  // Add additional hooks here\n}\n```\n\nSome properties will be slightly different to extend, for instance the `onInit` property:\n\n```\nconfig.onInit = async payload => {\n  if (incomingConfig.onInit) await incomingConfig.onInit(payload)\n\n  // Add additional onInit code by using the onInitExtension function\n  onInitExtension(pluginOptions, payload)\n}\n```\n\nIf you wish to add to the `onInit`, you must include the async/await. We don&apos;t use spread syntax in this case, instead you must await the existing `onInit` before running additional functionality.\n\nIn the template, we have stubbed out a basic `onInitExtension` file that you can use, if not needed feel free to delete it.\n\n## Types\n\nIf your plugin has options, you should define and provide types for these options in a separate file which gets exported from the main `index.ts`.\n\n```\nexport interface PluginTypes {\n  /**\n   * Enable or disable plugin\n   * @default false\n   */\n  enabled?: boolean\n}\n\n```\n\nIf possible, include [JSDoc comments](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html#types-1) to describe the options and their types. This allows a developer to see details about the options in their editor.\n\n## Best practices\n\nIn addition to the setup covered above, here are other best practices to follow:\n\n### Providing an enable / disable option\n\nFor a better user experience, provide a way to disable the plugin without uninstalling it.\n\n### Include tests in your GitHub CI workflow\n\nIf you&apos;ve configured tests for your package, integrate them into your workflow to run the tests each time you commit to the plugin repository. Learn more about [how to configure tests into your GitHub CI workflow.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-nodejs)\n\n### Publish your finished plugin to NPM\n\nThe best way to share and allow others to use your plugin once it is complete is to publish an NPM package. This process is straightforward and well documented, find out more about [creating and publishing a NPM package here](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages/).\n\n### Add payload-plugin topic tag\n\nApply the tag **payload-plugin** to your GitHub repository. This will boost the visibility of your plugin and ensure it gets listed with [existing payload plugins](https://github.com/topics/payload-plugin).\n\n### Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer)\n\nWith the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) system you release version numbers that reflect the nature of changes (major, minor, patch). Ensure all major versions reference their Payload compatibility.\n",

This requires no changes to your front-end code and very few changes to your Payload config.\n\n![Versions](/images/docs/vercel-visual-editing.jpg)\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Vercel Content Link is an enterprise-only feature and only available for deployments hosted on\n  Vercel. If you are an existing enterprise customer, [contact our sales\n  team](https://payloadcms.com/for-enterprise) for help with your integration.\n</Banner>\n\n## How it works\n\nTo power Vercel Content Link, Payload embeds Content Source Maps into its API responses. Content Source Maps are invisible, encoded JSON values that include a link back to the field in the CMS that generated the content. When rendered on the page, Vercel detects and decodes these values to display the Content Link interface.\n\nFor full details on how the encoding and decoding algorithm works, check out [`@vercel/stega`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/stega).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nSetting up Payload with Vercel Content Link is easy. First, install the `@payloadcms/plugin-csm` plugin into your project. This plugin requires an API key to install, [contact our sales team](https://payloadcms.com/for-enterprise) if you don't already have one.\n\n```bash\nnpm i @payloadcms/plugin-csm\n```\n\nThen in the `plugins` array of your Payload config, call the plugin and enable any collections that require Content Source Maps.\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from \"payload/config\"\nimport contentSourceMaps from \"@payloadcms/plugin-csm\"\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: \"pages\",\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'slug',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n        {\n          name: 'title,'\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    contentSourceMaps({\n      collections: [\"pages\"],\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\nNow in your Next.js app, include the `?encodeSourceMaps=true` parameter in any of your API requests. For performance reasons, this should only be done when in draft mode or on preview deployments.\n\n```ts\nif (isDraftMode || process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'preview') {\n  const res = await fetch(\n    `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_CMS_URL}/api/pages?where[slug][equals]=${slug}&encodeSourceMaps=true`,\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's it! You are now ready to enter Edit Mode and begin visually editing your content.\n\n#### Edit Mode\n\nTo see Content Link on your site, you first need to visit any preview deployment on Vercel and login using the Vercel Toolbar. When Content Source Maps are detected on the page, a pencil icon will appear in the toolbar. Clicking this icon will enable Edit Mode, highlighting all editable fields on the page in blue.\n\n![Versions](/images/docs/vercel-toolbar.jpg)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Date Fields\n\nThe plugin does not encode `date` fields by default, but for some cases like text that uses negative CSS letter-spacing, it may be necessary to split the encoded data out from the rendered text. This way you can safely use the cleaned data as expected.\n\n```ts\nimport { vercelStegaSplit } from '@vercel/stega'\nconst { cleaned, encoded } = vercelStegaSplit(text)\n```\n\n### Blocks and array fields\n\nAll `blocks` and `array` fields by definition do not have plain text strings to encode. For this reason, they are given an additional `_encodedSourceMap` property, which you can use to enable Content Link on entire _sections_ of your site. You can then specify the editing container by adding the `data-vercel-edit-target` HTML attribute to any top-level element of your block.\n\n```ts\n<div data-vercel-edit-target>\n  <span style={{ display: \"none\" }}>{_encodedSourceMap}</span>\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n",

You can invite multiple people to your team and each individual can belong to more than one team. You can assign them either `owner` or `user` permissions. Owners are able to make admin-only changes, such as deleting projects, and editing billing information.\n\n## Adding Members\n\nTo add a new member to your team, visit your Team’s Settings page, and click “Invite Teammate”. You can then add their email address, and assign their role. Press “Save” to send the invitations, which will send an email to the invited team member where they can create a new account.\n\n## Billing\n\nUsers can update billing settings and subscriptions for any teams where they are designated as an `owner`. To make updates to the team’s payment methods, visit the Billing page under the Team Settings tab. You can add new cards, delete cards, and set a payment method as a default. The default payment method will be used in the event that another payment method fails.\n\n## Subscriptions\n\nFrom the Subscriptions page, a team owner can see all current plans for their team. From here, you can see the price of each plan, if there is an active trial, and when you will be billed next.\n\n## Invoices\n\nThe Invoices page will you show you the invoices for your account, as well as the status on their payment.\n",

From\n  here, you can see your live URL, deployment details like timestamps and commit hash, as well as\n  the status of your deployment. You can also trigger a redeployment manually, which will rebuild\n  your project using the current configuration.\n</Banner>\n\n![Payload Cloud Overview Page](https://payloadcms.com/images/docs/cloud/overview-page.jpg)\n_A screenshot of the Overview page for a Cloud project._\n\n## Database\n\nYour Payload Cloud project comes with a MongoDB serverless Atlas DB instance or a Dedicated Atlas cluster, depending on your plan. To interact with your cloud database, you will be provided with a MongoDB connection string. This can be found under the **Database** tab of your project.\n\n`mongodb+srv://your_connection_string`\n\n## File Storage\n\nPayload Cloud gives you S3 file storage backed by Cloudflare as a CDN, and this plugin extends Payload so that all of your media will be stored in S3 rather than locally.\n\nAWS Cognito is used for authentication to your S3 bucket. The [Payload Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-cloud) will automatically pick up these values. These values are only if you'd like to access your files directly, outside of Payload Cloud.\n\n### Accessing Files Outside of Payload Cloud\n\nIf you'd like to access your files outside of Payload Cloud, you'll need to retrieve some values from your project's settings and put them into your environment variables. In Payload Cloud, navigate to the File Storage tab and copy the values using the copy button. Put these values in your .env file. Also copy the Cognito Password value separately and put into your .env file as well.\n\nWhen you are done, you should have the following values in your .env file:\n\n```env\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD=true\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT=prod\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_BUCKET=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_BUCKET_REGION=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_PASSWORD=\n```\n\nThe plugin will pick up these values and use them to access your files.\n\n## Build Settings\n\nYou can update settings from your Project’s Settings tab. Changes to your build settings will trigger a redeployment of your project.\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nFrom the Environment Variables page of the Settings tab, you can add, update and delete variables for use in your project. Like build settings, these changes will trigger a redeployment of your project.\n\n<Banner>\n  Note: For security reasons, any variables you wish to provide to the Admin panel must be prefixed\n  with `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_`.  Learn more\n  [here](../admin/environment-vars).\n</Banner>\n\n## Custom Domains\n\nWith Payload Cloud, you can add custom domain names to your project. To do so, first go to the Domains page of the Settings tab of your project. Here you can see your default domain. To add a new domain, type in the domain name you wish to use.\n\n<Banner>\n  Note: do not include the protocol (http:// or https://) or any paths (/page). Only include the\n  domain name and extension, and optionally a subdomain. - your-domain.com - backend.your-domain.com\n</Banner>\n\nOnce you click save, a DNS record will be generated for your domain name to point to your live project. Add this record into your DNS provider’s records, and once the records are resolving properly (this can take 1hr to 48hrs in some cases), your domain will now to point to your live project.\n\nYou will also need to configure your Payload project to use your specified domain. In your `payload.config.ts` file, specify your `serverURL` with your domain:\n\n```ts\nexport default buildConfig({\n  serverURL: 'https://example.com',\n  // the rest of your config,\n})\n```\n\n## Email\n\nPowered by [Resend](https://resend.com), Payload Cloud comes with integrated email support out of the box. No configuration is needed, and you can use `payload.sendEmail()` to send email right from your Payload app. To learn more about sending email with Payload, checkout the [Email Configuration](../email/overview) overview.\n\nIf you are on the Pro or Enterprise plan, you can add your own custom Email domain name. From the Email page of your project’s Settings, add the domain you wish to use for email delivery. This will generate a set of DNS records. Add these records to your DNS provider and click verify to check that your records are resolving properly. Once verified, your emails will now be sent from your custom domain name.\n\n## Developing Locally\n\nTo make changes to your project, you will need to clone the repository defined in your project settings to your local machine. In order to run your project locally, you will need configure your local environment first. Refer to your repository’s `README.md` file to see the steps needed for your specific template.\n\nFrom there, you are ready to make updates to your project. When you are ready to make your changes live, commit your changes to the branch you specified in your Project settings, and your application will automatically trigger a redeploy and build from your latest commit.\n\n## Cloud Plugin\n\nProjects generated from a template will come pre-configured with the official Cloud Plugin, but if you are using your own repository you will need to add this into your project. To do so, add the plugin to your Payload config:\n\n`yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-cloud`\n\n```js\nimport { payloadCloud } from '@payloadcms/plugin-cloud'\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  plugins: [payloadCloud()],\n  // rest of config\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  **Note:** If your Payload config already has an email with transport, this will take precedence\n  over Payload Cloud's email service.\n</Banner>\n\n#### **Optional configuration**\n\nIf you wish to opt-out of any Payload cloud features, the plugin also accepts options to do so.\n\n```js\npayloadCloud({\n  storage: false, // Disable file storage\n  email: false, // Disable email delivery\n})\n```\n",
